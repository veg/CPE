abstract: Understanding how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV envelope
  (Env) develop during natural infection can help guide the rational design of an
  HIV vaccine. Here, we described a bnAb lineage targeting the Env V2 apex and the
  Ab-Env co-evolution that led to development of neutralization breadth. The lineage
  Abs bore an anionic heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) of
  25 amino acids, among the shortest known for this class of Abs, and achieved breadth
  with only 10% nucleotide somatic hypermutation and no insertions or deletions. The
  data suggested a role for Env glycoform heterogeneity in the activation of the lineage
  germline B cell. Finally, we showed that localized diversity at key V2 epitope residues
  drove bnAb maturation toward breadth, mirroring the Env evolution pattern described
  for another donor who developed V2-apex targeting bnAbs. Overall, these findings
  suggest potential strategies for vaccine approaches based on germline-targeting
  and serial immunogen design.
