abstract: For investigations of human B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires, we have developed
  a protocol for large-scale surveys of human antibody heavy chain (VH) rearrangements.
  Here we study IgA repertoires, as more IgA antibodies are synthesized in the human
  body on a daily level than all other isotypes combined. In fact, IgA is secreted
  at all mucosal surfaces, and it is also secreted in the perspiration that coats
  our cutaneous surfaces. In these studies we can characterize the IgA clonal diversity
  of B-cell populations obtained from any donor. To recover representative repertoire
  libraries, we make our libraries from antibody gene transcript templates (i.e.,
  cDNA), as these are closer reflections of the immune repertoire expressed at the
  antibody protein level. To avoid biases potentially introduced by upstream oligonucleotide
  primers that hybridize to variable region framework regions, our approach also uses
  rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) of antibody transcripts. For exploration
  of human IgA responses, we have designed a duplexing antisense constant region primer
  that efficiently amplifies, side-by-side, heavy chain transcripts of both the IgA1
  and IgA2 subclasses. By these methods we have begun to define the molecular differences
  in the IgA1 and IgA2 responses occurring simultaneously in different donors. These
  methods will be used to investigate the effects of microbial virulence factors on
  host defenses, during autoimmune responses, and in B-cell malignancies.
