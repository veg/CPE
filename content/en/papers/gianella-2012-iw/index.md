abstract: We present a case of sexual transmission of HIV-1 predicted to have CXCR4-tropism
  during male-to-male sexual exposure. Phylogenetic analyses exclude cell-free virus
  in the seminal plasma of the source partner and possibly point to the seminal cells
  as the origin of the transmission event.
