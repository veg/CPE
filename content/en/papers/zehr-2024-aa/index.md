abstract: There are several examples of coronaviruses in the Betacoronavirus subgenus
  Embecovirus that have jumped from an animal to the human host. Studying how evolutionary
  factors shape coronaviruses in non-human hosts may provide insight into the coronavirus
  host-switching potential. Equids, such as horses and donkeys, are susceptible to
  equine coronaviruses (ECoVs). With increased testing prevalence, several ECoV genome
  sequences have become available for molecular evolutionary analyses, especially
  those from the United States of America (USA). To date, no analyses have been performed
  to characterize evolution within coding regions of the ECoV genome. Here, we obtain
  and describe four new ECoV genome sequences from infected equines from across the
  USA presenting clinical symptoms of ECoV, and infer ECoV-specific and Embecovirus-wide
  patterns of molecular evolution. Within two of the four data sets analyzed, we find
  evidence of intra-host evolution within the nucleocapsid (N) gene, suggestive of
  quasispecies development. We also identify 12 putative genetic recombination events
  within the ECoV genome, 11 of which fall in ORF1ab. Finally, we infer and compare
  sites subject to positive selection on the ancestral branch of each major Embecovirus
  member clade. Specifically, for the two currently identified human coronavirus (HCoV)
  embecoviruses that have spilled from animals to humans (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1),
  we find that there are 42 and 2 such sites, respectively, perhaps reflective of
  the more complex ancestral evolutionary history of HCoV-OC43, which involves several
  different animal hosts.IMPORTANCEThe Betacoronavirus subgenus Embecovirus contains
  coronaviruses that not only pose a health threat to animals and humans, but also
  have jumped from animal to human host. Equids, such as horses and donkeys are susceptible
  to equine coronavirus (ECoV) infections. No studies have systematically examined
  evolutionary patterns within ECoV genomes. Our study addresses this gap and provides
  insight into intra-host ECoV evolution from infected horses. Further, we identify
  and report natural selection pattern differences between two embecoviruses that
  have jumped from animals to humans [human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1 (HCoV-OC43 and
  HCoV-HKU1, respectively)], and hypothesize that the differences observed may be
  due to the different animal host(s) that each virus circulated in prior to its jump
  into humans. Finally, we contribute four novel, high-quality ECoV genomes to the
  scientific community.
