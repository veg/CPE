abstract: Understanding whether the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response impacts HIV-1
  superinfection and how superinfection subsequently modulates the NAb response can
  help clarify correlates of protection from HIV exposures and better delineate pathways
  of NAb development. We examined associations between the development of NAb and
  the occurrence of superinfection in a well-characterized, antiretroviral therapy
  (ART)-naive, primary infection cohort of men who have sex with men. Deep sequencing
  was applied to blood plasma samples from the cohort to detect cases of superinfection.
  We compared the NAb activity against autologous and heterologous viruses between
  10 participants with intrasubtype B superinfection and 19 monoinfected controls,
  matched to duration of infection and risk behavior. Three to 6 months after primary
  infection, individuals who would later become superinfected had significantly weaker
  NAb activity against tier 1 subtype B viruses (P = 0.003 for SF-162 and P = 0.017
  for NL4-3) and marginally against autologous virus (P = 0.054). Lower presuperinfection
  NAb responses correlated with weaker gp120 binding and lower plasma total IgG titers.
  Soon after superinfection, the NAb response remained lower, but between 2 and 3
  years after primary infection, NAb levels strengthened and reached those of controls.
  Superinfecting viruses were typically not susceptible to neutralization by presuperinfection
  plasma. These observations suggest that recently infected individuals with a delayed
  NAb response against primary infecting and tier 1 subtype B viruses are more susceptible
  to superinfection.IMPORTANCE Our findings suggest that within the first year after
  HIV infection, a relatively weak neutralizing antibody response against primary
  and subtype-specific neutralization-sensitive viruses increases susceptibility to
  superinfection in the face of repeated exposures. As natural infection progresses,
  the immune response strengthens significantly in some superinfected individuals.
  These findings will inform HIV vaccine design by providing testable correlates of
  protection from initial HIV infection.
