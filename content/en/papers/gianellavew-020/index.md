abstract: To design effective eradication strategies, it may be necessary to target
  HIV reservoirs in anatomic compartments other than blood. This study examined HIV
  RNA rebound following interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in blood and
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine whether the central nervous system (CNS)
  might serve as an independent source of resurgent viral replication.Paired blood
  and CSF samples were collected longitudinally from 14 chronically HIV-infected individuals
  undergoing ART interruption. HIV env (C2-V3), gag (p24) and pol (reverse transcriptase)
  were sequenced from cell-free HIV RNA and cell-associated HIV DNA in blood and CSF
  using the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform. Comprehensive sequence and phylogenetic
  analyses were performed to search for evidence of unique or differentially represented
  viral subpopulations emerging in CSF supernatant as compared with blood plasma.Using
  a conservative definition of compartmentalization based on four distinct statistical
  tests, nine participants presented a compartmentalized HIV RNA rebound within the
  CSF after interruption of ART, even when sampled within 2 weeks from viral rebound.
  The degree and duration of viral compartmentalization varied considerably between
  subjects and between time-points within a subject. In 10 cases, we identified viral
  populations within the CSF supernatant at the first sampled time-point after ART
  interruption, which were phylogenetically distinct from those present in the paired
  blood plasma and mostly persisted over time (when longitudinal time-points were
  available). Our data suggest that an independent source of HIV RNA contributes to
  viral rebound within the CSF after treatment interruption. The most likely source
  of compartmentalized HIV RNA is a CNS reservoir that would need to be targeted to
  achieve complete HIV eradication.
