abstract: Antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1 infected infants experience poor viral
  containment and rapid disease progression compared to adults. Viral factors (e.g.
  transmitted cytotoxic T- lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations) or infant factors (e.g.
  reduced CTL functional capacity) may explain this observation. We assessed CTL functionality
  by analysing selection in CTL-targeted HIV-1 epitopes following perinatal infection.
  HIV-1 gag, pol and nef sequences were generated from a historical repository of
  longitudinal specimens from 19 vertically infected infants. Evolutionary rate and
  selection were estimated for each gene and in CTL-restricted and non-restricted
  epitopes. Evolutionary rate was higher in nef and gag vs. pol, and lower in infants
  with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag and nef.
  Selection pressure was stronger in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs.
  severe immunosuppression across gag. The analysis also showed that infants with
  non-severe immunosuppression had stronger selection in CTL-restricted vs. non-restricted
  epitopes in gag and nef. Evidence of stronger CTL selection was absent in infants
  with severe immunosuppression. These data indicate that infant CTLs can exert selection
  pressure on gag and nef epitopes in early infection and that stronger selection
  across CTL epitopes is associated with favourable clinical outcomes. These results
  have implications for the development of paediatric HIV-1 vaccines.
