abstract: Ecological interaction networks, such as those describing the mutualistic
  interactions between plants and their pollinators or between plants and their frugivores,
  exhibit non-random structural properties that cannot be explained by simple models
  of network formation. One factor affecting the formation and eventual structure
  of such a network is its evolutionary history. We argue that this, in many cases,
  is closely linked to the evolutionary histories of the species involved in the interactions.
  Indeed, empirical studies of interaction networks along with the phylogenies of
  the interacting species have demonstrated significant associations between phylogeny
  and network structure. To date, however, no generative model explaining the way
  in which the evolution of individual species affects the evolution of interaction
  networks has been proposed. We present a model describing the evolution of pairwise
  interactions as a branching Markov process, drawing on phylogenetic models of molecular
  evolution. Using knowledge of the phylogenies of the interacting species, our model
  yielded a significantly better fit to 21% of a set of plant - pollinator and plant
  - frugivore mutualistic networks. This highlights the importance, in a substantial
  minority of cases, of inheritance of interaction patterns without excluding the
  potential role of ecological novelties in forming the current network architecture.
  We suggest that our model can be used as a null model for controlling evolutionary
  signals when evaluating the role of other factors in shaping the emergence of ecological
  networks.
