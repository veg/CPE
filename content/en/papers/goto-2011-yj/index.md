abstract: The endangered Przewalski's horse is the closest relative of the domestic
  horse and is the only true wild horse species surviving today. The question of whether
  Przewalski's horse is the direct progenitor of domestic horse has been hotly debated.
  Studies of DNA diversity within Przewalski's horses have been sparse but are urgently
  needed to ensure their successful reintroduction to the wild. In an attempt to resolve
  the controversy surrounding the phylogenetic position and genetic diversity of Przewalski's
  horses, we used massively parallel sequencing technology to decipher the complete
  mitochondrial and partial nuclear genomes for all four surviving maternal lineages
  of Przewalski's horses. Unlike single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing usually
  affected by ascertainment bias, the present method is expected to be largely unbiased.
  Three mitochondrial haplotypes were discovered-two similar ones, haplotypes I/II,
  and one substantially divergent from the other two, haplotype III. Haplotypes I/II
  versus III did not cluster together on a phylogenetic tree, rejecting the monophyly
  of Przewalski's horse maternal lineages, and were estimated to split 0.117-0.186
  Ma, significantly preceding horse domestication. In the phylogeny based on autosomal
  sequences, Przewalski's horses formed a monophyletic clade, separate from the Thoroughbred
  domestic horse lineage. Our results suggest that Przewalski's horses have ancient
  origins and are not the direct progenitors of domestic horses. The analysis of the
  vast amount of sequence data presented here suggests that Przewalski's and domestic
  horse lineages diverged at least 0.117 Ma but since then have retained ancestral
  genetic polymorphism and/or experienced gene flow.
