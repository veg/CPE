abstract: Rate heterogeneity among lineages is a common feature of molecular evolution,
  and it has long impeded our ability to accurately estimate the age of evolutionary
  divergence events. The development of relaxed molecular clocks, which model variable
  substitution rates among lineages, was intended to rectify this problem. Major subtypes
  of pandemic HIV-1 group M are thought to exemplify closely related lineages with
  different substitution rates. Here, we report that inferring the time of most recent
  common ancestor of all these subtypes in a single phylogeny under a single (relaxed)
  molecular clock produces significantly different dates for many of the subtypes
  than does analysis of each subtype on its own. We explore various methods to ameliorate
  this problem. We conclude that current molecular dating methods are inadequate for
  dealing with this type of substitution rate variation in HIV-1. Through simulation,
  we show that heterotachy causes root ages to be overestimated.
