abstract: 'BACKGROUND: 窶ィecause recently infected individuals disproportionately contribute
  to the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we evaluated the impact of
  a primary HIV screening program (the Early Test) implemented in San Diego. METHODS:
  窶サhe Early Test program used combined nucleic acid and serology testing to screen
  for primary infection targeting local high-risk individuals. Epidemiologic, HIV
  sequence, and geographic data were obtained from the San Diego County Department
  of Public Health and the Early Test program. Poisson regression analysis was performed
  to determine whether the Early Test program was temporally and geographically associated
  with changes in incident HIV diagnoses. Transmission chains were inferred by phylogenetic
  analysis of sequence data. RESULTS: 窶グver time, a decrease in incident HIV diagnoses
  was observed proportional to the number primary HIV infections diagnosed in each
  San Diego region (P < .001). Molecular network analyses also showed that transmission
  chains were more likely to terminate in regions where the program was marketed (P
  = .002). Although, individuals in these zip codes had infection diagnosed earlier
  (P = .08), they were not treated earlier (P = .83). CONCLUSIONS: 窶サhese findings
  suggests that early HIV diagnoses by this primary infection screening program probably
  contributed to the observed decrease in new HIV diagnoses in San Diego, and they
  support the expansion and evaluation of similar programs.'
