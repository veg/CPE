abstract: This article describes a set of alignments of 28 vertebrate genome sequences
  that is provided by the UCSC Genome Browser. The alignments can be viewed on the
  Human Genome Browser (March 2006 assembly) at http://genome.ucsc.edu, downloaded
  in bulk by anonymous FTP from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/multiz28way,
  or analyzed with the Galaxy server at http://g2.bx.psu.edu. This article illustrates
  the power of this resource for exploring vertebrate and mammalian evolution, using
  three examples. First, we present several vignettes involving insertions and deletions
  within protein-coding regions, including a look at some human-specific indels. Then
  we study the extent to which start codons and stop codons in the human sequence
  are conserved in other species, showing that start codons are in general more poorly
  conserved than stop codons. Finally, an investigation of the phylogenetic depth
  of conservation for several classes of functional elements in the human genome reveals
  striking differences in the rates and modes of decay in alignability. Each functional
  class has a distinctive period of stringent constraint, followed by decays that
  allow (for the case of regulatory regions) or reject (for coding regions and ultraconserved
  elements) insertions and deletions.
