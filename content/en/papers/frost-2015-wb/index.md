abstract: Identifying the germline genes involved in immunoglobulin rearrangements
  is an essential first step in the analysis of antibody repertoires. Based on our
  prior work in analysing diverse recombinant viruses, we present IgSCUEAL (Immunoglobulin
  Subtype Classification Using Evolutionary ALgorithms), a phylogenetic approach to
  assign V and J regions of immunoglobulin sequences to their corresponding germline
  alleles, with D regions assigned using a simple pairwise alignment algorithm. We
  also develop an interactive web application for viewing the results, allowing the
  user to explore the frequency distribution of sequence assignments and CDR3 region
  length statistics, which is useful for summarizing repertoires, as well as a detailed
  viewer of rearrangements and region alignments for individual query sequences. We
  demonstrate the accuracy and utility of our method compared with sequence similarity-based
  approaches and other non-phylogenetic model-based approaches, using both simulated
  data and a set of evaluation datasets of human immunoglobulin heavy chain sequences.
  IgSCUEAL demonstrates the highest accuracy of V and J assignment amongst existing
  approaches, even when the reassorted sequence is highly mutated, and can successfully
  cluster sequences on the basis of shared V/J germline alleles.
