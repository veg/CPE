abstract: The relative evolutionary rates at individual sites in proteins are informative
  measures of conservation or adaptation. Often used as evolutionarily-aware conservation
  scores, relative rates reveal key functional or strongly-selected residues. Estimating
  rates in a phylogenetic context requires specifying a protein substitution model,
  which is typically a phenomenological model trained on a large empirical dataset.
  A strong emphasis has traditionally been placed on selecting the \"best-fit\" model,
  with the implicit understanding that suboptimal or otherwise ill-fitting models
  might bias inferences. However, the pervasiveness and degree of such bias has not
  been systematically examined. We investigated how model choice impacts site-wise
  relative rates in a large set of empirical protein alignments. We compared models
  designed for use on any general protein, models designed for specific domains of
  life, and the simple equal-rates Jukes Cantor-style model (JC). As expected, information
  theoretic measures showed overwhelming evidence that some models fit the data decidedly
  better than others. By contrast, estimates of site-specific evolutionary rates were
  impressively insensitive to the substitution model used, revealing an unexpected
  degree of robustness to potential model misspecification. A deeper examination of
  the fewer than 5% of sites for which model inferences differed in a meaningful way
  showed that the JC model could uniquely identify rapidly-evolving sites that models
  with empirically-derived exchangeabilities failed to detect. We conclude that relative
  protein rates appear robust to the applied substitution model, and any sensible
  model of protein evolution, regardless of its fit to the data, should produce broadly
  consistent evolutionary rates.
