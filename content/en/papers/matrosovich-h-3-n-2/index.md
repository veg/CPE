abstract: The hemagglutinin (HA) of A/H3N2 pandemic influenza viruses (IAVs) of 1968
  differed from its inferred avian precursor by eight amino acid substitutions. To
  determine their phenotypic effects, we studied recombinant variants of A/Hong Kong/1/1968
  virus containing either human-type or avian-type amino acids in the corresponding
  positions of HA. The precursor HA displayed receptor binding profile and high conformational
  stability typical for duck IAVs. Substitutions Q226L and G228S, in addition to their
  known effects on receptor specificity and replication, marginally decreased HA stability.
  Substitutions R62I, D63N, D81N and N193S reduced HA binding avidity. Substitutions
  R62I, D81N and A144G promoted viral replication in human airway epithelial cultures.
  Analysis of HA sequences revealed that substitutions D63N and D81N accompanied by
  the addition of N-glycans represent common markers of avian H3 HA adaptation to
  mammals. Our results advance understanding of genotypic and phenotypic changes in
  IAV HA required for avian-to-human adaptation and pandemic emergence.
