abstract: Reports of a high frequency of the transmission of minority viral populations
  with drug-resistant mutations (DRM) are inconsistent with evidence that HIV-1 infections
  usually arise from mono- or oligoclonal transmission. We performed ultradeep sequencing
  (UDS) of partial HIV-1 gag, pol, and env genes from 32 recently infected individuals.
  We then evaluated overall and per-site diversity levels, selective pressure, sequence
  reproducibility, and presence of DRM and accessory mutations (AM). To differentiate
  biologically meaningful mutations from those caused by methodological errors, we
  obtained multinomial confidence intervals (CI) for the proportion of DRM at each
  site and fitted a binomial mixture model to determine background error rates for
  each sample. We then examined the association between detected minority DRM and
  the virologic failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Similar to other
  studies, we observed increased detection of DRM at low frequencies (average, 0.56%;
  95% CI, 0.43 to 0.69; expected UDS error, 0.21 $Â±$ 0.08% mutations/site). For 8
  duplicate runs, there was variability in the proportions of minority DRM. There
  was no indication of increased diversity or selection at DRM sites compared to other
  sites and no association between minority DRM and AM. There was no correlation between
  detected minority DRM and clinical failure of first-line ART. It is unlikely that
  minority viral variants harboring DRM are transmitted and maintained in the recipient
  host. The majority of low-frequency DRM detected using UDS are likely errors inherent
  to UDS methodology or a consequence of error-prone HIV-1 replication.
