abstract: 'Datamonkey is a popular web-based suite of phylogenetic analysis tools
  for use in evolutionary biology. Since the original release in 2005, we have expanded
  the analysis options to include recently developed algorithmic methods for recombination
  detection, evolutionary fingerprinting of genes, codon model selection, co-evolution
  between sites, identification of sites, which rapidly escape host-immune pressure
  and HIV-1 subtype assignment. The traditional selection tools have also been augmented
  to include recent developments in the field. Here, we summarize the analyses options
  currently available on Datamonkey, and provide guidelines for their use in evolutionary
  biology. Availability and documentation: http://www.datamonkey.org.'
