abstract: RNA viruses evolve very rapidly, often recombine, and are subject to strong
  host (immune response) and anthropogenic (antiretroviral drugs) selective forces.
  Given their compact and extensively sequenced genomes, comparative analysis of RNA
  viral data can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation,
  pathogenicity, immune evasion, and drug resistance. In this chapter, we present
  an example-based overview of recent advances in evolutionary models and statistical
  approaches that enable screening viral alignments for evidence of adaptive change
  in the presence of recombination, detecting bursts of directional adaptive evolution
  associated with the phenotypic changes, and detecting of coevolving sites in viral
  genes.
