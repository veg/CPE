abstract: The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing
  and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation,
  which is essential for tackling public health emergencies and requires unimpeded
  access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here, we show
  that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past
  10 years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure,
  can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling
  global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use
  all SARS-CoV-2 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore
  the importance of access to raw data and (2) demonstrate that existing community
  efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid,
  reproducible research during global health crises. All our analyses are fully documented
  at https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2.
