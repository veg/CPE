abstract: The ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to develop high
  levels of genetic diversity, and thereby acquire mutations to escape immune pressures,
  contributes to the difficulties in producing a vaccine. Possibly no single HIV-1
  sequence can induce sufficiently broad immunity to protect against a wide variety
  of infectious strains, or block mutational escape pathways available to the virus
  after infection. The authors describe the generation of HIV-1 immunogens that minimizes
  the phylogenetic distance of viral strains throughout the known viral population
  (the center of tree [COT]) and then extend the COT immunogen by addition of a composite
  sequence that includes high-frequency variable sites preserved in their native contexts.
  The resulting COT(+) antigens compress the variation found in many independent HIV-1
  isolates into lengths suitable for vaccine immunogens. It is possible to capture
  62% of the variation found in the Nef protein and 82% of the variation in the Gag
  protein into immunogens of three gene lengths. The authors put forward immunogen
  designs that maximize representation of the diverse antigenic features present in
  a spectrum of HIV-1 strains. These immunogens should elicit immune responses against
  high-frequency viral strains as well as against most mutant forms of the virus.
