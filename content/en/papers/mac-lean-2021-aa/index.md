abstract: Virus host shifts are generally associated with novel adaptations to exploit
  the cells of the new host species optimally. Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory
  Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant
  adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking
  place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution
  in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in
  SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying
  selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast,
  our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection
  acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied
  by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action
  of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2,
  RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that
  includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution
  in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered \"facilitating\"
  intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the
  progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human-human transmission as
  a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created
  a relatively generalist virus.
