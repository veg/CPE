abstract: As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with different patterns of spike protein mutations
  have emerged, the susceptibility of these variants to neutralization by antibodies
  has been rapidly assessed. However, neutralization data are generated using different
  approaches and are scattered across different publications making it difficult for
  these data to be located and synthesized. The Stanford Coronavirus Resistance Database
  (CoV-RDB; https://covdb.stanford.edu) is designed to house comprehensively curated
  published data on the neutralizing susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants and spike
  mutations to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), convalescent plasma (CP), and vaccinee
  plasma (VP). As of December 31, 2021, CoV-RDB encompassed 257 publications including
  91 (35%) containing 9,070 neutralizing mAb susceptibility results, 131 (51%) containing
  16,773 neutralizing CP susceptibility results, and 178 (69%) containing 33,540 neutralizing
  VP results. The database also records which spike mutations are selected during
  in vitro passage of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of mAbs and which emerge in persons
  receiving mAbs as treatment. The CoV-RDB interface interactively displays neutralizing
  susceptibility data at different levels of granularity by filtering and/or aggregating
  query results according to one or more experimental conditions. The CoV-RDB website
  provides a companion sequence analysis program that outputs information about mutations
  present in a submitted sequence and that also assists users in determining the appropriate
  mutation-detection thresholds for identifying non-consensus amino acids. The most
  recent data underlying the CoV-RDB can be downloaded in its entirety from a GitHub
  repository in a documented machine-readable format.
