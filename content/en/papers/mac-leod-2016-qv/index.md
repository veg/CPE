abstract: The high-mannose patch on HIV Env is a preferred target for broadly neutralizing
  antibodies (bnAbs), but to date, no vaccination regimen has elicited bnAbs against
  this region. Here, we present the development of a bnAb lineage targeting the high-mannose
  patch in an HIV-1 subtype-C-infected donor from sub-Saharan Africa. The Abs first
  acquired autologous neutralization, then gradually matured to achieve breadth. One
  Ab neutralized >47% of HIV-1 strains with only âˆ¼11% somatic hypermutation and no
  insertions or deletions. By sequencing autologous env, we determined key residues
  that triggered the lineage and participated in Ab-Env coevolution. Next-generation
  sequencing of the Ab repertoire showed an early expansive diversification of the
  lineage followed by independent maturation of individual limbs, several of them
  developing notable breadth and potency. Overall, the findings are encouraging from
  a vaccine standpoint and suggest immunization strategies mimicking the evolution
  of the entire high-mannose patch and promoting maturation of multiple diverse Ab
  pathways.
