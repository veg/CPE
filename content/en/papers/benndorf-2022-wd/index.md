abstract: "Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) emerged early in evolution and occur\
  \ in all domains of life and nearly in all species, including humans. Mutations\
  \ in four sHSPs (HspB1, HspB3, HspB5, HspB8) are associated with neuromuscular disorders.\
  \ The aim of this study is to investigate the evolutionary forces shaping these\
  \ sHSPs during vertebrate evolution. We performed comparative evolutionary analyses\
  \ on a set of orthologous sHSP sequences, based on the ratio of non-synonymous:\
  \ synonymous substitution rates for each codon. We found that these sHSPs had been\
  \ historically exposed to different degrees of purifying selection, decreasing in\
  \ this order: HspB8 > HspB1, HspB5 > HspB3. Within each sHSP, regions with different\
  \ degrees of purifying selection can be discerned, resulting in characteristic selective\
  \ pressure profiles. The conserved α-crystallin domains were exposed to the most\
  \ stringent purifying selection compared to the flanking regions, supporting a 'dimorphic\
  \ pattern' of evolution. Thus, during vertebrate evolution the different sequence\
  \ partitions were exposed to different and measurable degrees of selective pressures.\
  \ Among the disease-associated mutations, most are missense mutations primarily\
  \ in HspB1 and to a lesser extent in the other sHSPs. Our data provide an explanation\
  \ for this disparate incidence. Contrary to the expectation, most missense mutations\
  \ cause dominant disease phenotypes. Theoretical considerations support a connection\
  \ between the historic exposure of these sHSP genes to a high degree of purifying\
  \ selection and the unusual prevalence of genetic dominance of the associated disease\
  \ phenotypes. Our study puts the genetics of inheritable sHSP-borne diseases into\
  \ the context of vertebrate evolution."
