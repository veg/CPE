abstract: 'Background: HIV-1 genetic sequences can be used to infer viral transmission
  history and dynamics. Throughout the United States, HIV-1 sequences from drug resistance
  testing are reported to local public health departments. Methods: We investigated
  whether inferred HIV transmission network dynamics can identify individuals and
  clusters of individuals most likely to give rise to future HIV cases in a surveillance
  setting. We used HIV-TRACE, a genetic distance-based clustering tool, to infer molecular
  transmission clusters from HIV-1 pro/RT sequences from 65,736 people in the New
  York City surveillance registry. Logistic and LASSO regression analyses were used
  to identify correlates of clustering and cluster growth, respectively. We performed
  retrospective transmission network analyses to evaluate individual- and cluster-level
  prioritization schemes for identifying parts of the network most likely to give
  rise to new cases in the subsequent year. Results: Individual-level prioritization
  schemes predicted network growth better than random targeting. Across the 3,600
  inferred molecular transmission clusters, previous growth dynamics were superior
  predictors of future transmission cluster growth compared to individual-level prediction
  schemes. Cluster-level prioritization schemes considering previous cluster growth
  relative to cluster size further improved network growth predictions. Conclusions:
  Prevention efforts based on HIV molecular epidemiology may improve public health
  outcomes in a U.S. surveillance setting.'
