abstract: Coronaviruses are found in a diverse array of bat and bird species, which
  are believed to act as natural hosts. Molecular clock dating analyses of coronaviruses
  suggest that the most recent common ancestor of these viruses existed around 10,000
  years ago. This relatively young age is in sharp contrast to the ancient evolutionary
  history of their putative natural hosts, which began diversifying tens of millions
  of years ago. Here, we attempted to resolve this discrepancy by applying more realistic
  evolutionary models that have previously revealed the ancient evolutionary history
  of other RNA viruses. By explicitly modeling variation in the strength of natural
  selection over time and thereby improving the modeling of substitution saturation,
  we found that the time to the most recent ancestor common for all coronaviruses
  is likely far greater (millions of years) than the previously inferred range.
