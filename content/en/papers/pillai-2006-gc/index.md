abstract: HIV-1 often invades the CNS during primary infection, eventually resulting
  in neurological disorders in up to 50% of untreated patients. The CNS is a distinct
  viral reservoir, differing from peripheral tissues in immunological surveillance,
  target cell characteristics and antiretroviral penetration. Neurotropic HIV-1 likely
  develops distinct genotypic characteristics in response to this unique selective
  environment. We sought to catalogue the genetic features of CNS-derived HIV-1 by
  analysing 456 clonal RNA sequences of the C2-V3 env subregion generated from CSF
  and plasma of 18 chronically infected individuals. Neuropsychological performance
  of all subjects was evaluated and summarized as a global deficit score. A battery
  of phylogenetic, statistical and machine learning tools was applied to these data
  to identify genetic features associated with HIV-1 neurotropism and neurovirulence.
  Eleven of 18 individuals exhibited significant viral compartmentalization between
  blood and CSF (P < 0.01, Slatkin-Maddison test). A CSF-specific genetic signature
  was identified, comprising positions 9, 13 and 19 of the V3 loop. The residue at
  position 5 of the V3 loop was highly correlated with neurocognitive deficit (P <
  0.0025, Fisher's exact test). Antibody-mediated HIV-1 neutralizing activity was
  significantly reduced in CSF with respect to autologous blood plasma (P < 0.042,
  Student's t-test). Accordingly, CSF-derived sequences exhibited constrained diversity
  and contained fewer glycosylated and positively selected sites. Our results suggest
  that there are several genetic features that distinguish CSF- and plasma-derived
  HIV-1 populations, probably reflecting altered cellular entry requirements and decreased
  immune pressure in the CNS. Furthermore, neurological impairment may be influenced
  by mutations within the viral V3 loop sequence.
