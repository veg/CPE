abstract: Ciliates provide a powerful system to analyze the evolution of duplicated
  alpha-tubulin genes in the context of single-celled organisms. Genealogical analyses
  of ciliate alpha-tubulin sequences reveal five apparently recent gene duplications.
  Comparisons of paralogs in different ciliates implicate differing patterns of substitutions
  (e.g., ratios of replacement/synonymous nucleotides and radical/conservative amino
  acids) following duplication. Most substitutions between paralogs in Euplotes crassus,
  Halteria grandinella and Paramecium tetraurelia are synonymous. In contrast, alpha-tubulin
  paralogs within Stylonychia lemnae and Chilodonella uncinata are evolving at significantly
  different rates and have higher ratios of both replacement substitutions to synonymous
  substitutions and radical amino acid changes to conservative amino acid changes.
  Moreover, the amino acid substitutions in C. uncinata and S. lemnae paralogs are
  limited to short stretches that correspond to functionally important regions of
  the alpha-tubulin protein. The topology of ciliate alpha-tubulin genealogies are
  inconsistent with taxonomy based on morphology and other molecular markers, which
  may be due to taxonomic sampling, gene conversion, unequal rates of evolution, or
  asymmetric patterns of gene duplication and loss.
