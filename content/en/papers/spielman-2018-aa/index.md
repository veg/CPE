abstract: 'We introduce LEISR (Likehood Estimation of Individual Site Rates, pronounced
  \"laser\"), a tool to infer relative evolutionary rates from protein and nucleotide
  data, implemented in HyPhy. LEISR is based on the popular Rate4Site (Pupko et al.,
  2002) approach for inferring relative site-wise evolutionary rates, primarily from
  protein data. We extend the original method for more general use in several key
  ways: (i) we increase the support for nucleotide data with additional models, (ii)
  we allow for datasets of arbitrary size, (iii) we support analysis of site-partitioned
  datasets to correct for the presence of recombination breakpoints, (iv) we produce
  rate estimates at all sites rather than at just a subset of sites, and (v) we implemented
  LEISR as MPI-enabled to support rapid, high-throughput analysis. LEISR is available
  in HyPhy starting with version 2.3.8, and it is accessible as an option in the HyPhy
  analysis menu (\"Relative evolutionary rate inference\"), which calls the HyPhy
  batchfile LEISR.bf.'
