abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To examine the yield of HIV partner services provided to persons
  newly diagnosed with acute and early HIV infection (AEH) in San Diego, United States.
  DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: The study investigated the yield (i.e.
  number of new HIV and AEH diagnoses, genetically linked partnerships and high-risk
  uninfected partners) of partner services (confidential contact tracing) for individuals
  with AEH enrolled in the San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium 1996-2014.
  RESULTS: A total of 107 of 574 persons with AEH (19%; i.e. index cases) provided
  sufficient information to recruit 119 sex partners. Fifty-seven percent of the 119
  recruited partners were HIV infected, and 33% of the 119 were newly HIV diagnosed.
  Among those newly HIV diagnosed, 36% were diagnosed during AEH. There were no significant
  demographic or behavioral risk differences between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
  recruited partners. Genetic sequences were available for both index cases and partners
  in 62 partnerships, of which 61% were genetically linked. Partnerships in which
  both index case and partner enrolled within 30 days were more likely to yield a
  new HIV diagnosis (P = 0.01) and to be genetically linked (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:
  Partner services for persons with AEH within 30 days of diagnosis represents an
  effective tool to find HIV-unaware persons, including those with AEH who are at
  greatest risk of HIV transmission.'
