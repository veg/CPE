abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) can rapidly evolve due to selection
  pressures exerted by HIV-specific immune responses, antiviral agents, and to allow
  the virus to establish infection in different compartments in the body. Statistical
  models applied to HIV-1 sequence data can help to elucidate the nature of these
  selection pressures through comparisons of non-synonymous (or amino acid changing)
  and synonymous (or amino acid preserving) substitution rates. These models also
  need to take into account the non-independence of sequences due to their shared
  evolutionary history. We review how we have developed these methods and have applied
  them to characterize the evolution of HIV-1 in vivo. To illustrate our methods,
  we present an analysis of compartment-specific evolution of HIV-1 env in blood and
  cerebrospinal fluid and of site-to-site variation in the gag gene of subtype C HIV-1.
