abstract: Codon volatility is defined as the proportion of a codon's point-mutation
  neighbors that encode different amino acids. The cumulative volatility of a gene
  in relation to its associated genome was recently reported to be an indicator of
  selection pressure. We used this approach to measure selection on all available
  full-length HIV-1 subtype B genomes in the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and
  compared these estimates against those obtained via established likelihood- and
  distance-based comparative methods. Volatility failed to correlate with the results
  of any of the comparative methods demonstrating that it is not a reliable indicator
  of selection pressure.
