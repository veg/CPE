 abstract = {Codon volatility is defined as the proportion of a codon's point-mutation neighbors that encode different amino acids. The cumulative volatility of a gene in relation to its associated genome was recently reported to be an indicator of selection pressure. We used this approach to measure selection on all available full-length HIV-1 subtype B genomes in the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and compared these estimates against those obtained via established likelihood- and distance-based comparative methods. Volatility failed to correlate with the results of any of the comparative methods demonstrating that it is not a reliable indicator of selection pressure.},
