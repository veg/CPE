abstract: 'Recombination is an evolutionary process by which many pathogens generate
  diversity and acquire novel functions. Although a common occurrence during coronavirus
  replication, detection of recombination is only feasible when genetically distinct
  viruses contemporaneously infect the same host. Here, we identify an instance of
  SARS-CoV-2 superinfection, whereby an individual was infected with two distinct
  viral variants: Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Epsilon (B.1.429). This superinfection was first
  noted when an Alpha genome sequence failed to exhibit the classic S gene target
  failure behavior used to track this variant. Full genome sequencing from four independent
  extracts reveals that Alpha variant alleles comprise around 75% of the genomes,
  whereas the Epsilon variant alleles comprise around 20% of the sample. Further investigation
  reveals the presence of numerous recombinant haplotypes spanning the genome, specifically
  in the spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF 8 coding regions. These findings support the
  potential for recombination to reshape SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity.'
