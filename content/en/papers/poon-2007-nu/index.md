abstract: The addition of asparagine (N)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e., glycans)
  to the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
  envelope is not only required for correct protein folding, but also may provide
  protection against neutralizing antibodies as a \"glycan shield.\" As a result,
  strong host-specific selection is frequently associated with codon positions where
  nonsynonymous substitutions can create or disrupt potential N-linked glycosylation
  sites (PNGSs). Moreover, empirical data suggest that the individual contribution
  of PNGSs to the neutralization sensitivity or infectivity of HIV-1 may be critically
  dependent on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the envelope sequence. Here
  we evaluate how glycan-glycan interactions have shaped the evolution of HIV-1 envelope
  sequences by analyzing the distribution of PNGSs in a large-sequence alignment.
  Using a \"covarion\"-type phylogenetic model, we find that the rates at which individual
  PNGSs are gained or lost vary significantly over time, suggesting that the selective
  advantage of having a PNGS may depend on the presence or absence of other PNGSs
  in the sequence. Consequently, we identify specific interactions between PNGSs in
  the alignment using a new paired-character phylogenetic model of evolution, and
  a Bayesian graphical model. Despite the fundamental differences between these two
  methods, several interactions are jointly identified by both. Mapping these interactions
  onto a structural model of HIV-1 gp120 reveals that negative (exclusive) interactions
  occur significantly more often between colocalized glycans, while positive (inclusive)
  interactions are restricted to more distant glycans. Our results imply that the
  adaptive repertoire of alternative configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is
  limited by functional interactions between the N-linked glycans. This represents
  a potential vulnerability of rapidly evolving HIV-1 populations that may provide
  useful glycan-based targets for neutralizing antibodies.
