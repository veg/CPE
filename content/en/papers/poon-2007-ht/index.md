abstract: 'The third variable loop (V3) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
  (HIV-1) envelope is a principal determinant of antibody neutralization and progression
  to AIDS. Although it is undoubtedly an important target for vaccine research, extensive
  genetic variation in V3 remains an obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine.
  Comparative methods that exploit the abundance of sequence data can detect interactions
  between residues of rapidly evolving proteins such as the HIV-1 envelope, revealing
  biological constraints on their variability. However, previous studies have relied
  implicitly on two biologically unrealistic assumptions: (1) that founder effects
  in the evolutionary history of the sequences can be ignored, and; (2) that statistical
  associations between residues occur exclusively in pairs. We show that comparative
  methods that neglect the evolutionary history of extant sequences are susceptible
  to a high rate of false positives (20%-40%). Therefore, we propose a new method
  to detect interactions that relaxes both of these assumptions. First, we reconstruct
  the evolutionary history of extant sequences by maximum likelihood, shifting focus
  from extant sequence variation to the underlying substitution events. Second, we
  analyze the joint distribution of substitution events among positions in the sequence
  as a Bayesian graphical model, in which each branch in the phylogeny is a unit of
  observation. We perform extensive validation of our models using both simulations
  and a control case of known interactions in HIV-1 protease, and apply this method
  to detect interactions within V3 from a sample of 1,154 HIV-1 envelope sequences.
  Our method greatly reduces the number of false positives due to founder effects,
  while capturing several higher-order interactions among V3 residues. By mapping
  these interactions to a structural model of the V3 loop, we find that the loop is
  stratified into distinct evolutionary clusters. We extend our model to detect interactions
  between the V3 and C4 domains of the HIV-1 envelope, and account for the uncertainty
  in mapping substitutions to the tree with a parametric bootstrap.'
