abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 infects water and land
  fowl and can infect and cause mortality in mammals, including humans. However, HPAI
  H5N1 strains are not equally virulent in mammals, and some strains have been shown
  to cause only mild symptoms in experimental infections. Since most experimental
  studies of the basis of virulence in mammals have been small in scale, we undertook
  a meta-analysis of available experimental studies and used Bayesian graphical models
  (BGM) to increase the power of inference. We applied text-mining techniques to identify
  27 individual studies that experimentally determined pathogenicity in HPAI H5N1
  strains comprising 69 complete genome sequences. Amino acid sequence data in all
  11 genes were coded as binary data for the presence or absence of mutations related
  to virulence in mammals or nonconsensus residues. Sites previously implicated as
  virulence determinants were examined for association with virulence in mammals in
  this data set, and the sites with the most significant association were selected
  for further BGM analysis. The analyses show that virulence in mammals is a complex
  genetic trait directly influenced by mutations in polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and PB2,
  nonstructural 1 (NS1), and hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Several intra- and intersegment
  correlations were also found, and we postulate that there may be two separate virulence
  mechanisms involving particular combinations of polymerase and NS1 mutations or
  of NS1 and HA mutations.
