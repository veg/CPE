abstract: "BACKGROUND: Specific sequence changes of human immunodeficiency virus type\
  \ 1 (HIV-1) in the presence of specific HLA molecules may alter the composition\
  \ and processing of viral peptides, leading to immune escape. Persistence of these\
  \ mutations after transmission may leave the genetic fingerprint of the transmitter's\
  \ HLA profile. Here, we evaluated the associations between HLA profiles and the\
  \ phylogenetic relationships of HIV sequences sampled from a cohort of recently\
  \ infected individuals in San Diego, California. METHODS: We identified transmission\
  \ clusters within the study cohort, using phylogenetic analysis of sampled HIV pol\
  \ genotypes at a genetic distance of <1.5%. We then evaluated the association of\
  \ specific HLA alleles, HLA homozygosity, HLA concordance, race and ethnicity, and\
  \ mutational patterns within the clustering and nonclustering groups. RESULTS: From\
  \ 350 cohort participants, we identified 162 clustering individuals and 188 nonclustering\
  \ individuals. We identified trends for enrichment of particular alleles within\
  \ individual clusters and evidence of viral escape within those clusters. We also\
  \ found that discordance of HLA alleles was significantly associated with clustering\
  \ individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Some transmission clusters demonstrate HLA enrichment,\
  \ and viruses in these HLA-associated clusters often show evidence of escape to\
  \ enriched alleles. Interestingly, HLA discordance was associated with clustering\
  \ in our predominantly MSM population."
