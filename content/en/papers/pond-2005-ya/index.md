abstract: We develop a new model for studying the molecular evolution of protein-coding
  DNA sequences. In contrast to existing models, we incorporate the potential for
  site-to-site heterogeneity of both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates.
  We demonstrate that within-gene heterogeneity of synonymous substitution rates appears
  to be common. Using the new family of models, we investigate the utility of a variety
  of new statistical inference procedures, and we pay particular attention to issues
  surrounding the detection of sites undergoing positive selection. We discuss how
  failure to model synonymous rate variation in the model can lead to misidentification
  of sites as positively selected.
