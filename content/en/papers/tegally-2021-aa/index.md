abstract: Continued uncontrolled transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in many parts of the world
  is creating conditions for substantial evolutionary changes to the virus1,2. Here
  we describe a newly arisen lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (designated 501Y.V2; also known
  as B.1.351 or 20H) that is defined by eight mutations in the spike protein, including
  three substitutions (K417N, E484K and N501Y) at residues in its receptor-binding
  domain that may have functional importance3-5. This lineage was identified in South
  Africa after the first wave of the epidemic in a severely affected metropolitan
  area (Nelson Mandela Bay) that is located on the coast of the Eastern Cape province.
  This lineage spread rapidly, and became dominant in Eastern Cape, Western Cape and
  KwaZulu-Natal provinces within weeks. Although the full import of the mutations
  is yet to be determined, the genomic data-which show rapid expansion and displacement
  of other lineages in several regions-suggest that this lineage is associated with
  a selection advantage that most plausibly results from increased transmissibility
  or immune escape6-8.
