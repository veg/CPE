abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows the detection of minor
  variant HIV drug resistance mutations (DRMs). However data from new NGS platforms
  after Prevention-of-Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) regimen failure are limited.
  OBJECTIVE: To compare major and minor variant HIV DRMs with Illumina MiSeq and Life
  Technologies Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) in infants infected despite a PMTCT
  regimen. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study of NGS for detecting
  DRMs in infants infected despite a zidovudine (AZT) and Nevirapine (NVP) regimen,
  before initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy. Sequencing was performed
  on PCR products from plasma samples on PGM and MiSeq platforms. Bioinformatic analyses
  were undertaken using a codon-aware version of the Smith-Waterman mapping algorithm
  and a mixture multinomial error filtering statistical model. RESULTS: Of 15 infants,
  tested at a median age of 3.4 months after birth, 2 (13%) had non-nucleoside reverse
  transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRMs (K103N and Y181C) by bulk sequencing, whereas
  PGM detected 4 (26%) and MiSeq 5 (30%). NGS enabled the detection of additional
  minor variant DRMs in the infant with K103N. Coverage and instrument quality scores
  were higher with MiSeq, increasing the confidence of minor variant calls. CONCLUSIONS:
  NGS followed by bioinformatic analyses detected multiple minor variant DRMs in HIV-1
  RT among infants where PMTCT failed. The high coverage of MiSeq and high read quality
  improved the confidence of identified DRMs and may make this platform ideal for
  minor variant detection.'
