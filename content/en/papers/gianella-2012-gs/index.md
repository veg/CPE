abstract: 'The genital tract of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus
  type 1 (HIV-1) is an anatomic compartment that supports local HIV-1 and cytomegalovirus
  (CMV) replication. This study investigated the association of seminal CMV replication
  with changes in HIV-1 clonal expansion, evolution and phylogenetic compartmentalization
  between blood and semen. Fourteen paired blood and semen samples were analyzed from
  four untreated subjects. Clonal sequences (n = 607) were generated from extracted
  HIV-1 RNA (env C2-V3 region), and HIV-1 and CMV levels were measured in the seminal
  plasma by real-time PCR. Sequence alignments were evaluated for: (i) viral compartmentalization
  between semen and blood samples using Slatkin-Maddison and F(ST) methods, (ii) different
  nucleotide substitution rates in semen and blood, and (iii) association between
  proportions of clonal HIV-1 sequences in each compartment and seminal CMV levels.
  Half of the semen samples had detectable CMV DNA, with at least one CMV positive
  sample for each patient. Seminal CMV DNA levels correlated positively with seminal
  HIV-1 RNA levels (Spearman P = 0.05). A trend towards an association between compartmentalization
  of HIV-1 sequences sampled from blood and semen and presence of seminal CMV was
  observed (Cochran Q test P = 0.12). Evolutionary rates between semen and blood HIV-1
  populations did not differ significantly, and there was no significant association
  between seminal CMV DNA levels and the frequency of non-unique clonal HIV-1 sequences
  in the semen. In conclusion, the effects of CMV replication on HIV-1 viral and immunologic
  dynamics within the male genital tract are not significant enough to perturb evolution
  or disrupt compartmentalization in the genital tract.'
