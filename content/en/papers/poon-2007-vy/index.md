abstract: CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) perform a critical role in the immune
  control of viral infections, including those caused by human immunodeficiency virus
  type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). As a result, genetic variation at CTL
  epitopes is strongly influenced by host-specific selection for either escape from
  the immune response, or reversion due to the replicative costs of escape mutations
  in the absence of CTL recognition. Under strong CTL-mediated selection, codon positions
  within epitopes may immediately \"toggle\" in response to each host, such that genetic
  variation in the circulating virus population is shaped by rapid adaptation to immune
  variation in the host population. However, this hypothesis neglects the substantial
  genetic variation that accumulates in virus populations within hosts. Here, we evaluate
  this quantity for a large number of HIV-1- (n > or = 3,000) and HCV-infected patients
  (n > or = 2,600) by screening bulk RT-PCR sequences for sequencing \"mixtures\"
  (i.e., ambiguous nucleotides), which act as site-specific markers of genetic variation
  within each host. We find that nonsynonymous mixtures are abundant and significantly
  associated with codon positions under host-specific CTL selection, which should
  deplete within-host variation by driving the fixation of the favored variant. Using
  a simple model, we demonstrate that this apparently contradictory outcome can be
  explained by the transmission of unfavorable variants to new hosts before they are
  removed by selection, which occurs more frequently when selection and transmission
  occur on similar time scales. Consequently, the circulating virus population is
  shaped by the transmission rate and the disparity in selection intensities for escape
  or reversion as much as it is shaped by the immune diversity of the host population,
  with potentially serious implications for vaccine design.
