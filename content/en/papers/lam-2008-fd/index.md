abstract: H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have seriously affected
  the Asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003. The viruses pose a threat
  of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment
  leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we
  present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI
  viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential
  genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography
  suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and
  surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province.
  In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics
  of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more
  rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to
  their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic
  information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a
  focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying
  selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the
  emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding
  mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed
  reassortant viruses.
