abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the male genital tract may
  comprise virus produced locally in addition to virus transported from the circulation.
  Virus produced in the male genital tract may be genetically distinct, due to tissue-specific
  cellular characteristics and immunological pressures. HIV-1 env sequences derived
  from paired blood and semen samples from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database were
  analyzed to ascertain a male genital tract-specific viral signature. Machine learning
  algorithms could predict seminal tropism based on env sequences with accuracies
  exceeding 90%, suggesting that a strong genetic signature does exist for virus replicating
  in the male genital tract. Additionally, semen-derived viral populations exhibited
  constrained diversity (P < 0.05), decreased levels of positive selection (P < 0.025),
  decreased CXCR4 coreceptor utilization, and altered glycosylation patterns. Our
  analysis suggests that the male genital tract represents a distinct selective environment
  that contributes to the apparent genetic bottlenecks associated with the sexual
  transmission of HIV-1.
