abstract: Single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood (FEL),
  and several random effects likelihood (REL) methods were utilized to identify positively
  and negatively selected sites in sexually induced gene 1 (Sig1) of four different
  Thalassiosira species. The SLAC analysis did not find any sites affected by positive
  selection but suggested 13 sites influenced by negative selection. The SLAC approach
  may be too conservative because of low sequence divergence. The FEL and REL analyses
  revealed over 60 negatively selected sites and two positively selected sites that
  were unique to each method. The REL method may not be able to reliably identify
  individual sites under selection when applied to short sequences with low divergence.
  Instead, we proposed a new alignment-wide test for adaptive evolution based on codon
  models with variation in synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates among sites
  and found evidence for diversifying evolution without relying on site-by-site testing.
  The performance of the FEL and REL approaches was evaluated by subjecting the tests
  to a type I error rate simulation analysis, using the specific characteristics of
  the Sig1 data set. Simulation results indicated that the FEL test had reasonable
  Type I errors, while REL might have been too liberal, suggesting that the two positively
  selected sites identified by FEL (codons 94 and 174) are not likely to be false
  positives. The evolution of these codon sites, one of which is located in functional
  domain II, appears to be associated with divergence among the three major Thalassiosira
  lineages.
