abstract: "The evolution of lineage-specific gene families remains poorly studied\
  \ across the eukaryotic tree of life, with most analyses focusing on the recent\
  \ evolution of de novo genes in model species. Here we explore the origins of lineage-specific\
  \ genes in ciliates, a ~1 billion year old clade of microeukaryotes that are defined\
  \ by their division of somatic and germline functions into distinct nuclei. Previous\
  \ analyses on conserved gene families have shown the effect of ciliates' unusual\
  \ genome architecture on gene family evolution: extensive genome processing-the\
  \ generation of thousands of gene-sized somatic chromosomes from canonical germline\
  \ chromosomes-is associated with larger and more diverse gene families. To further\
  \ study the relationship between ciliate genome architecture and gene family evolution,\
  \ we analyzed lineage specific gene families from a set of 46 transcriptomes and\
  \ 12 genomes representing x species from eight ciliate classes. We assess how the\
  \ evolution lineage-specific gene families occurs among four groups of ciliates:\
  \ extensive fragmenters with gene-size somatic chromosomes, non-extensive fragmenters\
  \ with \\\"large'' multi-gene somatic chromosomes, Heterotrichea with highly polyploid\
  \ somatic genomes and Karyorelictea with 'paradiploid' somatic genomes. Our analyses\
  \ demonstrate that: 1) most lineage-specific gene families are found at shallow\
  \ taxonomic scales; 2) extensive genome processing (i.e., gene unscrambling) during\
  \ development likely influences the size and number of young lineage-specific gene\
  \ families; and 3) the influence of somatic genome architecture on molecular evolution\
  \ is increasingly apparent in older gene families. Altogether, these data highlight\
  \ the influences of genome architecture on the evolution of lineage-specific gene\
  \ families in eukaryotes."
