abstract: 'The imprint of natural selection on protein coding genes is often difficult
  to identify because selection is frequently transient or episodic, i.e. it affects
  only a subset of lineages. Existing computational techniques, which are designed
  to identify sites subject to pervasive selection, may fail to recognize sites where
  selection is episodic: a large proportion of positively selected sites. We present
  a mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) that is capable of identifying instances
  of both episodic and pervasive positive selection at the level of an individual
  site. Using empirical and simulated data, we demonstrate the superior performance
  of MEME over older models under a broad range of scenarios. We find that episodic
  selection is widespread and conclude that the number of sites experiencing positive
  selection may have been vastly underestimated.'
