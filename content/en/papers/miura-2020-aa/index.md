abstract: Pathogen timetrees are phylogenies scaled to time. They reveal the temporal
  history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary
  history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of
  pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is, temporally sampled sequences
  enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here, we present a new approach
  (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative
  rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct
  from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded
  by Bayesian approaches, and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of
  an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets, we found the accuracy of
  RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals
  (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets, RTDT produced dates that
  were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with
  Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD, TreeTime, and treedater), we found that
  no method performed the best in every scenario. So, we provide a brief guideline
  for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis. RTDT
  is implemented for use via a graphical user interface and in high-throughput settings
  in the newest release of cross-platform MEGA X software, freely available from http://www.megasoftware.net.
