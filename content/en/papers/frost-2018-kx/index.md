abstract: The evolution of viral pathogens is shaped by strong selective forces that
  are exerted during jumps to new hosts, confrontations with host immune responses
  and antiviral drugs, and numerous other processes. However, while undeniably strong
  and frequent, adaptive evolution is largely confined to small parts of information-packed
  viral genomes, and the majority of observed variation is effectively neutral. The
  predictions and implications of the neutral theory have proven immensely useful
  in this context, with applications spanning understanding within-host population
  structure, tracing the origins and spread of viral pathogens, predicting evolutionary
  dynamics, and modeling the emergence of drug resistance. We highlight the multiple
  ways in which the neutral theory has had an impact, which has been accelerated in
  the age of high-throughput, high-resolution genomics.
