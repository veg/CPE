abstract: We present a formalism for unifying the inference of population size from
  genetic sequences and mathematical models of infectious disease in populations.
  Virus phylogenies have been used in many recent studies to infer properties of epidemics.
  These approaches rely on coalescent models that may not be appropriate for infectious
  diseases. We account for phylogenetic patterns of viruses in susceptible-infected
  (SI), susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), and susceptible-infected-recovered
  (SIR) models of infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable alternative
  to demographic models used to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. The method allows epidemiological
  parameters, such as the reproductive number, to be estimated directly from viral
  sequence data. We also describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are often
  construed as arising from a short chain of transmissions. Our model reproduces the
  moments of the distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and may therefore serve
  as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes under simple epidemiological models. We examine
  a small cross-sectional sample of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 sequences collected
  in the United States and compare our results to standard estimates of effective
  population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent with estimates of effective
  population size and the known history of the HIV epidemic. While our model accurately
  estimates prevalence during exponential growth, we find that periods of decline
  are harder to identify.
