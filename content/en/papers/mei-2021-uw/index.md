abstract: The programmed frameshift element (PFE) rerouting translation from ORF1a
  to ORF1b is essential for propagation of coronaviruses. The combination of genomic
  features that make up PFE-the overlap between the two reading frames, a slippery
  sequence, as well as an ensemble of complex secondary structure elements-places
  severe constraints on this region as most possible nucleotide substitution may disrupt
  one or more of these elements. The vast amount of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data generated
  within the past year provides an opportunity to assess evolutionary dynamics of
  PFE in great detail. Here we performed a comparative analysis of all available coronaviral
  genomic data available to date. We show that the overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b
  evolved as a set of discrete 7, 16, 22, 25, and 31 nucleotide stretches with a well
  defined phylogenetic specificity. We further examined sequencing data from over
  1,500,000 complete genomes and 55,000 raw read datasets to demonstrate exceptional
  conservation and detect signatures of selection within the PFE region.
