abstract: Adaptive evolution frequently occurs in episodic bursts, localized to a
  few sites in a gene, and to a small number of lineages in a phylogenetic tree. A
  popular class of \"branch-site\" evolutionary models provides a statistical framework
  to search for evidence of such episodic selection. For computational tractability,
  current branch-site models unrealistically assume that all branches in the tree
  can be partitioned a priori into two rigid classes--\"foreground\" branches that
  are allowed to undergo diversifying selective bursts and \"background\" branches
  that are negatively selected or neutral. We demonstrate that this assumption leads
  to unacceptably high rates of false positives or false negatives when the evolutionary
  process along background branches strongly deviates from modeling assumptions. To
  address this problem, we extend Felsenstein's pruning algorithm to allow efficient
  likelihood computations for models in which variation over branches (and not just
  sites) is described in the random effects likelihood framework. This enables us
  to model the process at every branch-site combination as a mixture of three Markov
  substitution models--our model treats the selective class of every branch at a particular
  site as an unobserved state that is chosen independently of that at any other branch.
  When benchmarked on a previously published set of simulated sequences, our method
  consistently matched or outperformed existing branch-site tests in terms of power
  and error rates. Using three empirical data sets, previously analyzed for episodic
  selection, we discuss how modeling assumptions can influence inference in practical
  situations.
