 abstract = {Background: There are few large studies of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) prevalence and the drug resistance mutations (DRMs) responsible for TDR in the United States.
Methods: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were obtained from 4253 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals in a California clinic population from 2003 to 2016. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to study linkages between TDR strains and selection pressure on TDR-associated DRMs.
Results: From 2003 to 2016, there was a significant increase in overall (odds ratio [OR], 1.05 per year [95% confidence interval CI, 1.03-1.08]; P < .001) and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)-associated TDR (OR, 1.11 per year [95% CI, 1.08-1.15]; P < .001). Between 2012 and 2016, TDR rates to any drug class ranged from 15.7% to 19.2%, and class-specific rates ranged from 10.0% to 12.8% for NNRTIs, 4.1% to 8.1% for nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), and 3.6% to 5.2% for protease inhibitors. The thymidine analogue mutations, M184V/I and the tenofovir-associated DRMs K65R and K70E/Q/G/N/T accounted for 82.9%, 7.3%, and 1.4% of NRTI-associated TDR, respectively. Thirty-seven percent of TDR strains clustered with other TDR strains sharing the same DRMs.
Conclusions: Although TDR has increased significantly in this large cohort, many TDR strains are unlikely to influence the activity of currently preferred first-line ART regimens. The high proportion of DRMs associated with infrequently used regimens combined with the clustering of TDR strains suggest that some TDR strains are being transmitted between ART-naive individuals.},
