abstract: 'Background: There are few large studies of transmitted drug resistance
  (TDR) prevalence and the drug resistance mutations (DRMs) responsible for TDR in
  the United States. Methods: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse
  transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were obtained from 4253 antiretroviral
  therapy (ART)-naive individuals in a California clinic population from 2003 to 2016.
  Phylogenetic analyses were performed to study linkages between TDR strains and selection
  pressure on TDR-associated DRMs. Results: From 2003 to 2016, there was a significant
  increase in overall (odds ratio [OR], 1.05 per year [95% confidence interval CI,
  1.03-1.08]; P < .001) and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)-associated TDR (OR,
  1.11 per year [95% CI, 1.08-1.15]; P < .001). Between 2012 and 2016, TDR rates to
  any drug class ranged from 15.7% to 19.2%, and class-specific rates ranged from
  10.0% to 12.8% for NNRTIs, 4.1% to 8.1% for nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), and
  3.6% to 5.2% for protease inhibitors. The thymidine analogue mutations, M184V/I
  and the tenofovir-associated DRMs K65R and K70E/Q/G/N/T accounted for 82.9%, 7.3%,
  and 1.4% of NRTI-associated TDR, respectively. Thirty-seven percent of TDR strains
  clustered with other TDR strains sharing the same DRMs. Conclusions: Although TDR
  has increased significantly in this large cohort, many TDR strains are unlikely
  to influence the activity of currently preferred first-line ART regimens. The high
  proportion of DRMs associated with infrequently used regimens combined with the
  clustering of TDR strains suggest that some TDR strains are being transmitted between
  ART-naive individuals.'
