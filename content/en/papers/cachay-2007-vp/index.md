abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Frequent methamphetamine use among recently HIV infected individuals
  is associated with transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
  inhibitors (NNRTI); however, the reversion time of TDR to drug susceptible HIV may
  exceed 3 years. We assessed whether recreational substance use is associated with
  detectable TDR among individuals newly diagnosed with HIV infection of unknown duration.
  DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled at the University
  California, San Diego Early Intervention Program. Demographic, clinical and substance
  use data were collected using structured interviews. Genotypic resistance testing
  was performed using GeneSeq, Monogram Biosciences. We analyzed the association between
  substance use and TDR using bivariate analyses and the corresponding transmission
  networks using phylogenetic models. RESULTS: Between April 2004 and July 2006, 115
  individuals with genotype data were enrolled. The prevalence of alcohol, marijuana
  and methamphetamine use were 98%, 71% and 64% respectively. Only active methamphetamine
  use in the 30 days prior to HIV diagnosis was independently associated with TDR
  to NNRTI (OR: 6.6; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Despite not knowing the duration of their
  HIV infection, individuals reporting active methamphetamine use in the 30 days prior
  to HIV diagnosis are at an increased risk of having HIV strains that are resistant
  to NNRTI.'
