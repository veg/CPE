abstract: Previous studies have shown that the majority of long-lived cells harboring
  persistent HIV-1 proviral genomes originates from viruses circulating in the year
  prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, but a smaller proportion originates
  from viruses circulating much earlier in untreated infection. These observations
  suggest that discrete biological factors influence the entry and persistence of
  viruses into the persistent proviral pool, and there may be periods earlier in untreated
  infection with increased seeding. Therefore, we examined the timing of formation
  of the long-lived pool of infected cells that persists during ART in seven women
  (after a median of 5.1 years of suppressive ART) by comparing the phylogenetic distance
  between unique 3' half genome on-ART proviral sequences and longitudinally sampled
  pre-ART viral RNA sequences, focusing on the period >1 year prior to ART initiation
  (i.e., the \"early\" proviral pool). We constructed models of continuous entry into
  the persistent proviral pool prior to ART initiation and analyzed the fit of our
  experimentally derived data to these models. We found that the pattern of persistent
  proviral pool formation in five of seven participants is incongruent with a model
  of continuous entry, implying that persistent proviral pool formation can occur
  episodically during untreated infection. Notably, increased entry into the persistent
  proviral pool was not universally observed during acute infection, and the timing
  of enhanced early entry differed across the participants.IMPORTANCECells harboring
  HIV-1 proviruses that persist on antiretroviral therapy (ART) constitute the main
  barrier to an HIV-1 cure. Recent work has elucidated that the majority of persisting
  proviruses harbor HIV-1 variants circulating near the time of ART initiation, whether
  the proviruses are intact or defective, though a portion forms earlier in untreated
  infection. We examined the formation of the \"early-forming\" persistent proviral
  pool and found that in 5/7 participants, persistent proviral pool formation was
  episodic, rather than continuous, suggesting that there are host/biological factors
  that periodically enhance the formation of the persistent proviral pool. Further
  characterization of these factors will aid in the development of methods to abrogate
  their effect, thereby reducing the size of the persistent proviral pool.
