abstract: HIV-1 dual infection (DI) and CXCR4 (X4) coreceptor usage are associated
  with accelerated disease progression but frequency and dynamics of coreceptor usage
  during DI is unknown. Ultradeep sequencing was used to interrogate for DI and infer
  coreceptor usage in longitudinal blood samples of 102 subjects. At baseline, X4
  usage was high (23 subjects harbored X4 variants) and was not associated with infection
  duration or DI. Coreceptor usage changed over time in 12 of 47 participants, and
  X4 usage emerged in 4 of 41 monoinfections vs 2 of 5 superinfections (P = .12),
  suggesting a weak statistical trend toward occurrence of superinfection and acquiring
  X4 usage.
