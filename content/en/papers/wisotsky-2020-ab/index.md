abstract: Most molecular evolutionary studies of natural selection maintain the decades-old
  assumption that synonymous substitution rate variation (SRV) across sites within
  genes occurs at levels that are either nonexistent or negligible. However, numerous
  studies challenge this assumption from a biological perspective and show that SRV
  is comparable in magnitude to that of nonsynonymous substitution rate variation.
  We evaluated the impact of this assumption on methods for inferring selection at
  the molecular level by incorporating SRV into an existing method (BUSTED) for detecting
  signatures of episodic diversifying selection in genes. Using simulated data we
  found that failing to account for even moderate levels of SRV in selection testing
  is likely to produce intolerably high false positive rates. To evaluate the effect
  of the SRV assumption on actual inferences we compared results of tests with and
  without the assumption in an empirical analysis of over 13,000 Euteleostomi (bony
  vertebrate) gene alignments from the Selectome database. This exercise reveals that
  close to 50% of positive results (i.e., evidence for selection) in empirical analyses
  disappear when SRV is modeled as part of the statistical analysis and are thus candidates
  for being false positives. The results from this work add to a growing literature
  establishing that tests of selection are much more sensitive to certain model assumptions
  than previously believed.
