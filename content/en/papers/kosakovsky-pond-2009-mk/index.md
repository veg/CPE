abstract: How many species inhabit our immediate surroundings? A straightforward collection
  technique suitable for answering this question is known to anyone who has ever driven
  a car at highway speeds. The windshield of a moving vehicle is subjected to numerous
  insect strikes and can be used as a collection device for representative sampling.
  Unfortunately the analysis of biological material collected in that manner, as with
  most metagenomic studies, proves to be rather demanding due to the large number
  of required tools and considerable computational infrastructure. In this study,
  we use organic matter collected by a moving vehicle to design and test a comprehensive
  pipeline for phylogenetic profiling of metagenomic samples that includes all steps
  from processing and quality control of data generated by next-generation sequencing
  technologies to statistical analyses and data visualization. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is also the first publication that features a live online supplement
  providing access to exact analyses and workflows used in the article.
