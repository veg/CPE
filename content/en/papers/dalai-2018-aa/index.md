abstract: The HIV epidemic in San Mateo County is sustained by multiple overlapping
  risk groups and is an important hub for HIV transmission in northern California.
  Limited access to care has led historically to delayed clinical presentation, higher
  rates of opportunistic infections, and an increased prevalence of antiretroviral
  drug resistance. The virologic and clinical consequences of treatment within these
  multiple ethnic and behavioral groups are poorly understood, highlighting the need
  for efficient surveillance strategies that are able to elucidate transmission networks
  and drug resistance patterns. We obtained sequence data from a group of 316 HIV-positive
  individuals in the San Mateo AIDS Program over a 14-year period and integrated epidemiologic,
  phylogenetic, and network approaches to characterize transmission clusters, risk
  factors and drug resistance. Drug resistance mutations were identified using the
  Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in
  RAxML and subjected to clustering analysis in Cluster Picker. Network analysis using
  pairwise genetic distances was performed in HIV-TRACE. Participants were primarily
  male (60%), white Hispanics and non-Hispanics (32%) and African American (20.6%).
  The most frequent behavior risk factor was male-male sex (33.5%), followed by heterosexual
  (23.4%) and injection drug use (9.5%). Nearly all sequences were subtype B (96%)
  with subtypes A, C, and CRF01_AE also observed. Sequences from 65% of participants
  had at least one drug resistance mutation. Clustered transmissions included a higher
  number of women when compared to non-clustered individuals and were more likely
  to include heterosexual or people who inject drugs (PWID). Detailed analysis of
  the largest network (N = 47) suggested that PWID played a central role in overall
  transmission of HIV-1 as well as bridging men who have sex with men (MSM) transmission
  with heterosexual/PWID among primarily African American men. Combined phylogenetic
  and network analysis of HIV sequence data identified several overlapping risk factors
  in the epidemic, including MSM, heterosexual and PWID transmission with a disproportionate
  impact on African Americans and a high prevalence of drug resistance.
