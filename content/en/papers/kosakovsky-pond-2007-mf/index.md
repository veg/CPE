abstract: The choice of a probabilistic model to describe sequence evolution can and
  should be justified. Underfitting the data through the use of overly simplistic
  models may miss out on interesting phenomena and lead to incorrect inferences. Overfitting
  the data with models that are too complex may ascribe biological meaning to statistical
  artifacts and result in falsely significant findings. We describe a likelihood-based
  approach for evolutionary model selection. The procedure employs a genetic algorithm
  (GA) to quickly explore a combinatorially large set of all possible time-reversible
  Markov models with a fixed number of substitution rates. When applied to stem RNA
  data subject to well-understood evolutionary forces, the models found by the GA
  1) capture the expected overall rate patterns a priori; 2) fit the data better than
  the best available models based on a priori assumptions, suggesting subtle substitution
  patterns not previously recognized; 3) cannot be rejected in favor of the general
  reversible model, implying that the evolution of stem RNA sequences can be explained
  well with only a few substitution rate parameters; and 4) perform well on simulated
  data, both in terms of goodness of fit and the ability to estimate evolutionary
  rates. We also investigate the utility of several distance measures for comparing
  and contrasting inferred evolutionary models. Using widely available small computer
  clusters, our approach allows, for the first time, to evaluate the performance of
  existing RNA evolutionary models by comparing them with a large pool of candidate
  models and to validate common modeling assumptions. In addition, the new method
  provides the foundation for rigorous selection and comparison of substitution models
  for other types of sequence data.
