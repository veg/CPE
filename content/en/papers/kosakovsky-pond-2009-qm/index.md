abstract: Genetically diverse pathogens (such as Human Immunodeficiency virus type
  1, HIV-1) are frequently stratified into phylogenetically or immunologically defined
  subtypes for classification purposes. Computational identification of such subtypes
  is helpful in surveillance, epidemiological analysis and detection of novel variants,
  e.g., circulating recombinant forms in HIV-1. A number of conceptually and technically
  different techniques have been proposed for determining the subtype of a query sequence,
  but there is not a universally optimal approach. We present a model-based phylogenetic
  method for automatically subtyping an HIV-1 (or other viral or bacterial) sequence,
  mapping the location of breakpoints and assigning parental sequences in recombinant
  strains as well as computing confidence levels for the inferred quantities. Our
  Subtype Classification Using Evolutionary ALgorithms (SCUEAL) procedure is shown
  to perform very well in a variety of simulation scenarios, runs in parallel when
  multiple sequences are being screened, and matches or exceeds the performance of
  existing approaches on typical empirical cases. We applied SCUEAL to all available
  polymerase (pol) sequences from two large databases, the Stanford Drug Resistance
  database and the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database. Comparing with subtypes which
  had previously been assigned revealed that a minor but substantial (approximately
  5%) fraction of pure subtype sequences may in fact be within- or inter-subtype recombinants.
  A free implementation of SCUEAL is provided as a module for the HyPhy package and
  the Datamonkey web server. Our method is especially useful when an accurate automatic
  classification of an unknown strain is desired, and is positioned to complement
  and extend faster but less accurate methods. Given the increasingly frequent use
  of HIV subtype information in studies focusing on the effect of subtype on treatment,
  clinical outcome, pathogenicity and vaccine design, the importance of accurate,
  robust and extensible subtyping procedures is clear.
