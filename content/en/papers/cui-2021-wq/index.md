abstract: Whether freshwater fish colonize remote islands following tectonic or transoceanic
  dispersal remains an evolutionary puzzle. Integrating dating of known tectonic events
  with phylogenomics and current species distribution, we find that killifish species
  distribution eludes species dispersal by tectonic drift only. Investigating the
  colonization of a non-annual killifish (Pachypanchax playfairii) on the Seychelle
  islands, we found genetic support for trans-oceanic dispersal and experimentally
  discovered an adaptation to complete tolerance to seawater. At the macroevolutionary
  scale, despite their long-lasting isolation, non-annual golden panchax show stronger
  genome-wide purifying selection than annual killifishes from continental Africa.
  However, progressive decline in effective population size in a more recent time-scale
  likely led to the segregation of slightly deleterious mutations across golden panchax
  populations, which represents a potential threat for species preservation on the
  long run.
