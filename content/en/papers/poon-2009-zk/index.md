abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Human populations are structured by social networks, in which
  individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes
  that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called
  because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also
  at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health
  agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks
  in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven
  sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data,
  however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis.
  Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that
  the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a
  branching process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we develop a new methodology
  based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling
  tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to
  an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population
  at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis
  C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using
  our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available
  software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization
  methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified
  significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions
  of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate
  the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of
  like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. CONCLUSIONS: SCFGs
  provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure
  in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that
  has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation
  of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical
  implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.'
