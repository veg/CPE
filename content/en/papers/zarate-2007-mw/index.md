abstract: 'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects different organs and tissues.
  During these infection events, subpopulations of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) develop and,
  if viral trafficking is restricted between subpopulations, the viruses can follow
  independent evolutionary histories, i.e., become compartmentalized. This phenomenon
  is usually detected via comparative sequence analysis and has been reported for
  viruses isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and the genital tract. Several
  approaches have been proposed to study the compartmentalization of HIV sequences,
  but to date, no rigorous comparison of the most commonly employed methods has been
  made. In this study, we systematically compared inferences made by six different
  methods for detecting compartmentalization based on three data sets: (i) a sample
  of 45 patients with sequences gathered from the CNS, (ii) sequences from the female
  genital tract of 18 patients, and (iii) a set of simulated sequences. We found that
  different methods often reached contradictory conclusions. Methods based on the
  topology of a phylogenetic tree derived from clonal sequences were generally more
  sensitive in detecting compartmentalization than those that relied solely upon pairwise
  genetic distances between sequences. However, as the branching structure in a phylogenetic
  tree is often uncertain, especially for short, low-diversity, or recombinant sequences,
  tree-based approaches may need to be modified to take phylogenetic uncertainty into
  account. Given the frequently discordant predictions of different methods and the
  strengths and weaknesses of each particular methodology, we recommend that a suite
  of several approaches be used for reliable inference of compartmentalized population
  structure.'
