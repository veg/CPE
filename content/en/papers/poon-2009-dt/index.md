abstract: Natural selection is a fundamental process affecting all evolving populations.
  In the simplest case, positive selection increases the frequency of alleles that
  confer a fitness advantage relative to the rest of the population, or increases
  its genetic diversity, and negative selection removes those alleles that are deleterious.
  Codon-based models of molecular evolution are able to infer signatures of selection
  from alignments of homologous sequences by estimating the relative rates of synonymous
  (dS) and non-synonymous substitutions (dN). Datamonkey (http://www.datamonkey.org)
  provides a user-friendly web interface to a wide collection of state-of-the-art
  statistical techniques for estimating dS and dN and identifying codons and lineages
  under selection, even in the presence of recombinant sequences.
