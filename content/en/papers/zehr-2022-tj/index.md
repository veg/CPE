abstract: A canine coronavirus (CCoV) has now been reported from two independent human
  samples from Malaysia (respiratory, collected in 2017-2018; CCoV-HuPn-2018) and
  Haiti (urine, collected in 2017); these two viruses were nearly genetically identical.
  In an effort to identify any novel adaptations associated with this apparent shift
  in tropism we carried out detailed evolutionary analyses of the spike gene of this
  virus in the context of related Alphacoronavirus 1 species. The spike 0-domain retains
  homology to CCoV2b (enteric infections) and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus
  (TGEV; enteric and respiratory). This domain is subject to relaxed selection pressure
  and an increased rate of molecular evolution. It contains unique amino acid substitutions,
  including within a region important for sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in
  TGEV. Overall, the spike gene is extensively recombinant, with a feline coronavirus
  type II strain serving a prominent role in the recombinant history of the virus.
  Molecular divergence time for a segment of the gene where temporal signal could
  be determined, was estimated at around 60 years ago. We hypothesize that the virus
  had an enteric origin, but that it may be losing that particular tropism, possibly
  because of mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain.
