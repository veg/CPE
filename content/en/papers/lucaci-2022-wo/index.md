abstract: 'An important component of efforts to manage the ongoing COVID19 pandemic
  is the R apid A ssessment of how natural selection contributes to the emergence
  and proliferation of potentially dangerous S ARS-CoV-2 lineages and CL ades (RASCL).
  The RASCL pipeline enables continuous comparative phylogenetics-based selection
  analyses of rapidly growing clade-focused genome surveillance datasets, such as
  those produced following the initial detection of potentially dangerous variants.
  From such datasets RASCL automatically generates down-sampled codon alignments of
  individual genes/ORFs containing contextualizing background reference sequences,
  analyzes these with a battery of selection tests, and outputs results as both machine
  readable JSON files, and interactive notebook-based visualizations. AVAILABILITY:
  RASCL is available from a dedicated repository at https://github.com/veg/RASCL and
  as a Galaxy workflow https://usegalaxy.eu/u/hyphy/w/rascl . Existing clade/variant
  analysis results are available here: https://observablehq.com/@aglucaci/rascl .
