abstract: Evolutionary models that make use of site-specific parameters have recently
  been criticized on the grounds that parameter estimates obtained under such models
  can be unreliable and lack theoretical guarantees of convergence. We present a simulation
  study providing empirical evidence that a simple version of the models in question
  does exhibit sensible convergence behavior and that additional taxa, despite not
  being independent of each other, lead to improved parameter estimates. Although
  it would be desirable to have theoretical guarantees of this, we argue that such
  guarantees would not be sufficient to justify the use of these models in practice.
  Instead, we emphasize the importance of taking the variance of parameter estimates
  into account rather than blindly trusting point estimates - this is standardly done
  by using the models to construct statistical hypothesis tests, which are then validated
  empirically via simulation studies.
