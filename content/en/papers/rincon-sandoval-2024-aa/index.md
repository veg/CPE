abstract: Habitat transitions have shaped the evolutionary trajectory of many clades.
  Sea catfishes (Ariidae) have repeatedly undergone ecological transitions, including
  colonizing freshwaters from marine environments, leading to an adaptive radiation
  in Australia and New Guinea alongside non-radiating freshwater lineages elsewhere.
  Here, we generate and analyze one long-read reference genome and 66 short-read whole
  genome assemblies, in conjunction with genomic data for 54 additional species. We
  investigate how three major ecological transitions have shaped genomic variation
  among ariids over their ~ 50 million-year evolutionary history. Our results show
  that relatively younger freshwater lineages exhibit a higher incidence of positive
  selection than their more ancient marine counterparts. They also display a larger
  disparity in body shapes, a trend that correlates with a heightened occurrence of
  positive selection on genes associated with body size and elongation. Although positive
  selection in the Australia and New Guinea radiation does not stand out compared
  to non-radiating lineages overall, selection across the prolactin gene family during
  the marine-to-freshwater transition suggests that strong osmoregulatory adaptations
  may have facilitated their colonization and radiation. Our findings underscore the
  significant role of selection in shaping the genome and organismal traits in response
  to habitat shifts across macroevolutionary scales.
