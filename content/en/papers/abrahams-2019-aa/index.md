abstract: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective at suppressing
  HIV-1 replication, the virus persists as a latent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells
  during therapy. This reservoir forms even when ART is initiated early after infection,
  but the dynamics of its formation are largely unknown. The viral reservoirs of individuals
  who initiate ART during chronic infection are generally larger and genetically more
  diverse than those of individuals who initiate therapy during acute infection, consistent
  with the hypothesis that the reservoir is formed continuously throughout untreated
  infection. To determine when viruses enter the latent reservoir, we compared sequences
  of replication-competent viruses from resting peripheral CD4+ T cells from nine
  HIV-positive women on therapy to viral sequences circulating in blood collected
  longitudinally before therapy. We found that, on average, 71% of the unique viruses
  induced from the post-therapy latent reservoir were most genetically similar to
  viruses replicating just before ART initiation. This proportion is far greater than
  would be expected if the reservoir formed continuously and was always long lived.
  We conclude that ART alters the host environment in a way that allows the formation
  or stabilization of most of the long-lived latent HIV-1 reservoir, which points
  to new strategies targeted at limiting the formation of the reservoir around the
  time of therapy initiation.
