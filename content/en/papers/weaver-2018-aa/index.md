abstract: Inference of how evolutionary forces have shaped extant genetic diversity
  is a cornerstone of modern comparative sequence analysis. Advances in sequence generation
  and increased statistical sophistication of relevant methods now allow researchers
  to extract ever more evolutionary signal from the data, albeit at an increased computational
  cost. Here, we announce the release of Datamonkey 2.0, a completely re-engineered
  version of the Datamonkey web-server for analyzing evolutionary signatures in sequence
  data. For this endeavor, we leveraged recent developments in open-source libraries
  that facilitate interactive, robust, and scalable web application development. Datamonkey
  2.0 provides a carefully curated collection of methods for interrogating coding-sequence
  alignments for imprints of natural selection, packaged as a responsive (i.e. can
  be viewed on tablet and mobile devices), fully interactive, and API-enabled web
  application. To complement Datamonkey 2.0, we additionally release HyPhy Vision,
  an accompanying JavaScript application for visualizing analysis results. HyPhy Vision
  can also be used separately from Datamonkey 2.0 to visualize locally-executed HyPhy
  analyses. Together, Datamonkey 2.0 and HyPhy Vision showcase how scientific software
  development can benefit from general-purpose open-source frameworks. Datamonkey
  2.0 is freely and publicly available at http://www.datamonkey. org, and the underlying
  codebase is available from https://github.com/veg/datamonkey-js.
