abstract: Although it is known that most HIV-1 infections worldwide result from exposure
  to virus in semen, it has not yet been established whether transmitted strains originate
  as RNA virions in seminal plasma or as integrated proviral DNA in infected seminal
  leukocytes. We present phylogenetic evidence that among six transmitting pairs of
  men who have sex with men, blood plasma virus in the recipient is consistently more
  closely related to the seminal plasma virus in the source. All sequences were subtype
  B, and the env C2V3 of transmitted variants tended to have higher mean isoelectric
  points, contain potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and favor CCR5 co-receptor
  usage. A statistically robust phylogenetically corrected analysis did not detect
  genetic signatures reliably associated with transmission, but further investigation
  of larger samples of transmitting pairs holds promise for determining which structural
  and genetic features of viral genomes are associated with transmission.
