abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global health crisis to occur in the
  age of big genomic data.Although data generation capacity is well established and
  sufficiently standardized, analytical capacity is not. To establish analytical capacity
  it is necessary to pull together global computational resources and deliver the
  best open source tools and analysis workflows within a ready to use, universally
  accessible resource. Such a resource should not be controlled by a single research
  group, institution, or country. Instead it should be maintained by a community of
  users and developers who ensure that the system remains operational and populated
  with current tools. A community is also essential for facilitating the types of
  discourse needed to establish best analytical practices. Bringing together public
  computational research infrastructure from the USA, Europe, and Australia, we developed
  a distributed data analysis platform that accomplishes these goals. It is immediately
  accessible to anyone in the world and is designed for the analysis of rapidly growing
  collections of deep sequencing datasets. We demonstrate its utility by detecting
  allelic variants in high-quality existing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets and by
  continuous reanalysis of COG-UK data. All workflows, data, and documentation is
  available at https://covid19.galaxyproject.org .
