abstract: People with HIV-1 (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) can maintain undetectable
  virus levels, but a small pool of infected cells persists. This pool is largely
  comprised of defective proviruses that may produce HIV-1 proteins but are incapable
  of making infectious virus, with only a fraction (~10%) of these cells harboring
  intact viral genomes, some of which produce infectious virus following ex vivo stimulation
  (i.e. inducible intact proviruses). A majority of the inducible proviruses that
  persist on ART are formed near the time of therapy initiation. Here we compared
  proviral DNA (assessed here as 3' half genomes amplified from total cellular DNA)
  and inducible replication competent viruses in the pool of infected cells that persists
  during ART to determine if the original infection of these cells occurred at comparable
  times prior to therapy initiation. Overall, the average percent of proviruses that
  formed late (i.e. around the time of ART initiation, 60%) did not differ from the
  average percent of replication competent inducible viruses that formed late (69%),
  and this was also true for proviral DNA that was hypermutated (57%). Further, there
  was no evidence that entry into the long-lived infected cell pool was impeded by
  the ability to use the CXCR4 coreceptor, nor was the formation of long-lived infected
  cells enhanced during primary infection, when viral loads are exceptionally high.
  We observed that infection of cells that transitioned to be long-lived was enhanced
  among people with a lower nadir CD4+ T cell count. Together these data suggest that
  the timing of infection of cells that become long-lived is impacted more by biological
  processes associated with immunodeficiency before ART than the replication competency
  and/or cellular tropism of the infecting virus or the intactness of the provirus.
  Further research is needed to determine the mechanistic link between immunodeficiency
  and the timing of infected cells transitioning to the long-lived pool, particularly
  whether this is due to differences in infected cell clearance, turnover rates and/or
  homeostatic proliferation before and after ART.
