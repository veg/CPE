abstract: 'UNLABELLED: Spidermonkey is a new component of the Datamonkey suite of
  phylogenetic tools that provides methods for detecting coevolving sites from a multiple
  alignment of homologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences. It reconstructs the
  substitution history of the alignment by maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic methods,
  and then analyzes the joint distribution of substitution events using Bayesian graphical
  models to identify significant associations among sites. AVAILABILITY: Spidermonkey
  is publicly available both as a web application at http://www.data-monkey.org and
  as a stand-alone component of the phylogenetic software package HyPhy, which is
  freely distributed on the web (http://www.hyphy.org) as precompiled binaries and
  open source.'
