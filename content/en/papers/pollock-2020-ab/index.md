abstract: Due to the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic there exists a strong
  desire to understand where the SARS-CoV-2 virus came from and how it jumped species
  boundaries to humans. Molecular evolutionary analyses can trace viral origins by
  establishing relatedness and divergence times of viruses and identifying past selective
  pressures. However, we must uphold rigorous standards of inference and interpretation
  on this topic because of the ramifications of being wrong. Here, we dispute the
  conclusions of Xia (2020. Extreme genomic CpG deficiency in SARS-CoV-2 and evasion
  of host antiviral defense. Mol Biol Evol. doi:10.1093/molbev/masa095) that dogs
  are a likely intermediate host of a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor. We highlight major flaws
  in Xia's inference process and his analysis of CpG deficiencies, and conclude that
  there is no direct evidence for the role of dogs as intermediate hosts. Bats and
  pangolins currently have the greatest support as ancestral hosts of SARS-CoV-2,
  with the strong caveat that sampling of wildlife species for coronaviruses has been
  limited.
