abstract: Lentiviral RNA genomes contain structural elements that play critical roles
  in viral replication. Although structural features of 5'-untranslated regions have
  been well characterized, attempts to identify important structures in other genomic
  regions by Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE)
  have led to conflicting structural and mechanistic conclusions. Previous approaches
  accounted neither for sequence heterogeneity that is ubiquitous in viral populations,
  nor for selective constraints operating at the protein level. We developed an approach
  that augments SHAPE with phylogenetic analyses and applied it to investigate structure
  in coding regions (cRNA) within the HIV and SIV envelope genes. Analysis of single-genome
  SHAPE data with phylogenetic information from diverse lentiviral sequences argues
  against the conservation of a putative global gp120 RNA structure but points to
  the existence of core RNA sub-structures. Our findings establish a framework for
  considering sequence heterogeneity and protein function in de novo RNA structure
  inference approaches.
