abstract: 'Background: There are few large studies of transmitted drug resistance
  (TDR) prevalence and the drug resistance mutations (DRMs) responsible for TDR in
  the U.S. Methods: HIV-1 RT and protease sequences were obtained from 4,253 antiretroviral
  therapy (ART)-naı̈ve individuals in a California clinic population from 2003-2016.
  Phylogenetic analyses were performed to study linkages between TDR strains and selection
  pressure on TDR-associated DRMs. Results: From 2003-2016, there was a significant
  increase in overall (odds ratio [OR]=1.05 per year; 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.08; p<0.001)
  and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)-associated TDR (OR=1.11 per year; 95% CI:
  1.08 - 1.15; p<0.001). Between 2012 and 2016, TDR rates to any drug class ranged
  from 15.7%-19.2%, and class-specific rates ranged from 10.0%-12.8% for NNRTIs, 4.1%-8.1%
  for nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), and 3.6%-5.2% for protease inhibitors. K103N/S,
  Y181C, Y188L, and G190A mutations accounted for 88.5% of NNRTI-associated TDR. The
  thymidine analog mutations, M184V/I, and the tenofovir-associated DRMs K65R and
  K70E/Q/G/N/T accounted for 82.9%, 7.3%, and 1.4% of NRTI-associated TDR, respectively.
  The proportions of individuals with low-level resistance or higher to boosted atazanavir
  and darunavir were 2.2% and 0.3%, respectively. 37% of TDR strains clustered with
  other TDR strains sharing the same DRMs. Conclusions: Although TDR has increased
  significantly in this large cohort, many TDR strains are unlikely to influence the
  activity of currently preferred first-line ART regimens. The high proportion of
  DRMs associated with infrequently used regimens combined with the clustering of
  TDR strains suggest that some TDR strains are being transmitted between ART-näve
  individuals.'
