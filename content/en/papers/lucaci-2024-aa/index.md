abstract: Rad And Gem-Like GTP-Binding Protein 2 (Rem2), a member of the RGK family
  of Ras-like GTPases, is implicated in Huntington's disease and Long QT Syndrome
  and is highly expressed in the brain and endocrine cells. We examine the evolutionary
  history of Rem2 identified in various mammalian species, focusing on the role of
  purifying selection and coevolution in shaping its sequence and protein structural
  constraints. Our analysis of Rem2 sequences across 175 mammalian species found evidence
  for strong purifying selection in 70% of non-invariant codon sites which is characteristic
  of essential proteins that play critical roles in biological processes and is consistent
  with Rem2's role in the regulation of neuronal development and function. We inferred
  epistatic effects in 50 pairs of codon sites in Rem2, some of which are predicted
  to have deleterious effects on human health. Additionally, we reconstructed the
  ancestral evolutionary history of mammalian Rem2 using protein structure prediction
  of extinct and extant sequences which revealed the dynamics of how substitutions
  that change the gene sequence of Rem2 can impact protein structure in variable regions
  while maintaining core functional mechanisms. By understanding the selective pressures,
  protein- and gene - interactions that have shaped the sequence and structure of
  the Rem2 protein, we gain a stronger understanding of its biological and functional
  constraints.
