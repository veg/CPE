abstract: We surveyed the molecular evolutionary characteristics of 25 plant gene
  families, with the goal of better understanding general processes in plant gene
  family evolution. The survey was based on 247 GenBank sequences representing four
  grass species (maize, rice, wheat, and barley). For each gene family, orthology
  and paralogy relationships were uncertain. Recognizing this uncertainty, we characterized
  the molecular evolution of each gene family in four ways. First, we calculated the
  ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (d(N)/d(S)) both on branches
  of gene phylogenies and across codons. Our results indicated that the d(N)/d(S)
  ratio was statistically heterogeneous across branches in 17 of 25 (68%) gene families.
  The vast majority of d(N)/d(S) estimates were <1.0, suggestive of selective constraint
  on amino acid replacements, and no estimates were >1.0, either across phylogenetic
  lineages or across codons. Second, we tested separately for nonsynonymous and synonymous
  molecular clocks. Sixty-eight percent of gene families rejected a nonsynonymous
  molecular clock, and 52% of gene families rejected a synonymous molecular clock.
  Thus, most gene families in this study deviated from clock-like evolution at either
  synonymous or nonsynonymous sites. Third, we calculated the effective number of
  codons and the proportion of G+C synonymous sites for each sequence in each gene
  family. One or both quantities vary significantly within 18 of 25 gene families.
  Finally, we tested for gene conversion, and only six gene families provided evidence
  of gene conversion events. Altogether, evolution for these 25 gene families is marked
  by selective constraint that varies among gene family members, a lack of molecular
  clock at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, and substantial variation in codon
  usage.
