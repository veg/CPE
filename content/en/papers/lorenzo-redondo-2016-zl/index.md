abstract: Lymphoid tissue is a key reservoir established by HIV-1 during acute infection.
  It is a site associated with viral production, storage of viral particles in immune
  complexes, and viral persistence. Although combinations of antiretroviral drugs
  usually suppress viral replication and reduce viral RNA to undetectable levels in
  blood, it is unclear whether treatment fully suppresses viral replication in lymphoid
  tissue reservoirs. Here we show that virus evolution and trafficking between tissue
  compartments continues in patients with undetectable levels of virus in their bloodstream.
  We present a spatial and dynamic model of persistent viral replication and spread
  that indicates why the development of drug resistance is not a foregone conclusion
  under conditions in which drug concentrations are insufficient to completely block
  virus replication. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary and infection
  dynamics of the virus population within the host, revealing that HIV-1 can continue
  to replicate and replenish the viral reservoir despite potent antiretroviral therapy.
