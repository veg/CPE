 abstract = {UNLABELLED: Datamonkey is a web interface to a suite of cutting edge maximum likelihood-based tools for identification of sites subject to positive or negative selection. The methods range from very fast data exploration to the some of the most complex models available in public domain software, and are implemented to run in parallel on a cluster of computers.
AVAILABILITY: http://www.datamonkey.org. In the future, we plan to expand the collection of available analytic tools, and provide a package for installation on other systems.},
