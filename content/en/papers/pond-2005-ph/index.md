abstract: 'UNLABELLED: Datamonkey is a web interface to a suite of cutting edge maximum
  likelihood-based tools for identification of sites subject to positive or negative
  selection. The methods range from very fast data exploration to the some of the
  most complex models available in public domain software, and are implemented to
  run in parallel on a cluster of computers. AVAILABILITY: http://www.datamonkey.org.
  In the future, we plan to expand the collection of available analytic tools, and
  provide a package for installation on other systems.'
