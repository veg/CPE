abstract: HIV type 1 (HIV-1) can rapidly escape from neutralizing antibody responses.
  The genetic basis of this escape in vivo is poorly understood. We compared the pattern
  of evolution of the HIV-1 env gene between individuals with recent HIV infection
  whose virus exhibited either a low or a high rate of escape from neutralizing antibody
  responses. We demonstrate that the rate of viral escape at a phenotypic level is
  highly variable among individuals, and is strongly correlated with the rate of amino
  acid substitutions. We show that dramatic escape from neutralizing antibodies can
  occur in the relative absence of changes in glycosylation or insertions and deletions
  (\"indels\") in the envelope; conversely, changes in glycosylation and indels occur
  even in the absence of neutralizing antibody responses. Comparison of our data with
  the predictions of a mathematical model support a mechanism in which escape from
  neutralizing antibodies occurs via many amino acid substitutions, with low cross-neutralization
  between closely related viral strains. Our results suggest that autologous neutralizing
  antibody responses may play a pivotal role in the diversification of HIV-1 envelope
  during the early stages of infection.
