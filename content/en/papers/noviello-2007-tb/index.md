abstract: Viruses encounter changing selective pressures during transmission between
  hosts, including host-specific immune responses and potentially varying functional
  demands on specific proteins. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein
  performs several functions potentially important for successful infection, including
  immune escape via down-regulation of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I)
  and direct enhancement of viral infectivity and replication. Nef is also a major
  target of the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. To examine the impact
  of changing selective pressures on Nef functions following sexual transmission,
  we analyzed genetic and functional changes in nef clones from six transmission events.
  Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the diversity of nef was similar in both sources
  and acutely infected recipients, the patterns of selection across transmission were
  variable, and regions of Nef associated with distinct functions evolved similarly
  in sources and recipients. These results weighed against the selection of specific
  Nef functions by transmission or during acute infection. Measurement of Nef function
  provided no evidence that the down-regulation of either CD4 or MHC-I was optimized
  by transmission or during acute infection, although rare nef clones from sources
  that were impaired in these activities were not detected in recipients. Nef-specific
  CTL activity was detected as early as 3 weeks after infection and appeared to be
  an evolutionary force driving the diversification of nef. Despite the change in
  selective pressure between the source and recipient immune systems and concomitant
  genetic diversity, the majority of Nef proteins maintained robust abilities to down-regulate
  MHC-I and CD4. These data suggest that both functions are important for the successful
  establishment of infection in a new host.
