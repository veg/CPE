abstract: Global sequencing of hundreds of thousands of genomes of Severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has continued to reveal new genetic variants
  that are the key to unraveling its early evolutionary history and tracking its global
  spread over time. Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history and
  spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of thousands of high-quality
  genomes. We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, reconstructed
  through a novel application and advancement of computational methods initially developed
  to infer the mutational history of tumor cells in a patient. This progenitor genome
  differs from genomes of the first coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants,
  implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise
  to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and
  the USA harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting
  that the progenitor was spreading worldwide months before and after the first reported
  cases of COVID-19 in China. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced
  many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting
  based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated
  North America for most of the pandemic in 2020. There have been multiple replacements
  of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence
  of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America. We have developed
  a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and spatiotemporal trends of
  SARS-CoV-2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).
