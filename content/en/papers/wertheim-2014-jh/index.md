abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is pandemic, but its contemporary
  global transmission network has not been characterized. A better understanding of
  the properties and dynamics of this network is essential for surveillance, prevention,
  and eventual eradication of HIV. Here, we apply a simple and computationally efficient
  network-based approach to all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the
  global database, revealing a contemporary picture of the spread of HIV-1 within
  and between countries. This approach automatically recovered well-characterized
  transmission clusters and extended other clusters thought to be contained within
  a single country across international borders. In addition, previously undescribed
  transmission clusters were discovered. Together, these clusters represent all known
  modes of HIV transmission. The extent of international linkage revealed by our comprehensive
  approach demonstrates the need to consider the global diversity of HIV, even when
  describing local epidemics. Finally, the speed of this method allows for near-real-time
  surveillance of the pandemic's progression.
