abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Examine associations among behaviors including substance use
  during sexual encounters, and transmitted HIV drug resistance in recently HIV-infected
  men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: Between 2002 and 2006, 117 recently HIV-infected
  MSM completed questionnaires regarding their 3 most recent sexual partners. Serum
  samples were tested for the presence of genotypic and phenotypic HIV drug resistance.
  Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of substance use,
  behaviors, and resistance to at least 1 class of HIV drugs. RESULTS: The mean age
  of participants was 35 years; 71% identified as white and 19% as Hispanic. Sixty
  (51%) reported substance use during sexual activity in the past 12 months. A total
  of 12.5% of 112 had genotypic drug resistance to at least 1 class of antiretroviral
  medications, and 14% of 117 had phenotypic drug resistance. Substances used during
  sexual activity associated with phenotypic drug resistance in multivariate models
  included any substance use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.21, 95% confidence interval
  [CI]: 1.13 to 15.68), polysubstance use (aOR = 5.64, 95% CI: 1.62 to 19.60), methamphetamine
  (aOR = 4.00, 95% CI: 1.19 to 13.38), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA)/Ecstasy
  (aOR = 7.16, 95% CI: 1.40 to 36.59), and gamma-hydroxyl butyrate (GHB) (aOR = 6.98,
  95% CI: 1.82 to 26.80). The genotype analysis was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Among these
  recently HIV-infected MSM, methamphetamine use during sexual activity and use of
  other substances, such as MDMA and GHB, was associated with acquired drug-resistant
  virus. No other behaviors associated with acquisition of drug-resistant HIV.'
