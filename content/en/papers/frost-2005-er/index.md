abstract: We analyzed neutralization sensitivity and genetic variation of transmitted
  subtype B human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in eight recently infected
  men who have sex with men and the virus from the six subjects who infected them.
  In contrast to reports of heterosexual transmission of subtype C HIV-1, in which
  the transmitted virus appears to be more neutralization sensitive, we demonstrate
  that in our study population, relatively few phenotypic changes in neutralization
  sensitivity or genotypic changes in envelope occurred during transmission of subtype
  B HIV-1. We suggest that limited genetic variation within the infecting host reduces
  the likelihood of selective transmission of neutralization-sensitive HIV.
