abstract: Standard genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing, performed by bulk
  sequencing, does not readily detect variants that comprise <20% of the circulating
  HIV-1 RNA population. Nevertheless, it is valuable in selecting an antiretroviral
  regimen after antiretroviral failure. In patients with poor adherence, resistant
  variants may not reach this threshold. Therefore, deep sequencing would be potentially
  valuable for detecting minority resistant variants. We compared bulk sequencing
  and deep sequencing to detect HIV-1 drug resistance at the time of a second-line
  protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimen failure. Eligibility criteria
  were virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA load of >500 copies/ml) of a first-line nonnucleoside
  reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen, with at least the M184V mutation
  (lamivudine resistance), and second-line failure of a lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based
  regimen. An amplicon-sequencing approach on the Roche 454 system was used. Six patients
  with viral loads of >90,000 copies/ml and one patient with a viral load of 520 copies/ml
  were included. Mutations not detectable by bulk sequencing during first- and second-line
  failure were detected by deep sequencing during second-line failure. Low-frequency
  variants (>0.5% of the sequence population) harboring major protease inhibitor resistance
  mutations were found in 5 of 7 patients despite poor adherence to the LPV/r-based
  regimen. In patients with intermittent adherence to a boosted PI regimen, deep sequencing
  may detect minority PI-resistant variants, which likely represent early events in
  resistance selection. In patients with poor or intermittent adherence, there may
  be low evolutionary impetus for such variants to reach fixation, explaining the
  low prevalence of PI resistance.
