abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Characterize intra-individual HIV-1 subtype B pol evolution
  in antiretroviral naive individuals. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study of individuals
  enrolled during primary infection. METHODS: Eligible individuals were antiretroviral
  naı̈ve participants enrolled in the cohort from December 1997-December 2005 and
  having at least two blood samples available with the first one collected within
  a year of their estimated date of infection. Population-based pol sequences were
  generated from collected blood samples and analyzed for genetic divergence over
  time in respect to dual infection status, HLA, CD4 count and viral load. RESULTS:
  93 participants were observed for a median of 1.8 years (Mean = 2.2 years, SD =1.9
  years). All participants classified as mono-infected had less than 0.7% divergence
  between any two of their pol sequences using the Tamura-Nei model (TN93), while
  individuals with dual infection had up to 7.0% divergence. The global substitution
  rates (substitutions/nucleotide/year) for mono and dually infected individuals were
  significantly different (p<0.001); however, substitution rates were not associated
  with HLA haplotype, CD4 or viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Even after a maximum of almost
  9 years of follow-up, all mono-infected participants had less than 1% divergence
  between baseline and longitudinal sequences, while participants with dual infection
  had 10 times greater divergence. These data support the use of HIV-1 pol sequence
  data to evaluate transmission events, networks and HIV-1 dual infection.'
