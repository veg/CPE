abstract: Noroviruses are the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. An increase
  in the number of globally reported norovirus outbreaks was seen the past decade,
  especially for outbreaks caused by successive genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4) variants.
  Whether this observed increase was due to an upswing in the number of infections,
  or to a surveillance artifact caused by heightened awareness and concomitant improved
  reporting, remained unclear. Therefore, we set out to study the population structure
  and changes thereof of GII.4 strains detected through systematic outbreak surveillance
  since the early 1990s. We collected 1383 partial polymerase and 194 full capsid
  GII.4 sequences. A Bayesian MCMC coalescent analysis revealed an increase in the
  number of GII.4 infections during the last decade. The GII.4 strains included in
  our analyses evolved at a rate of 4.3-9.0x10(-3) mutations per site per year, and
  share a most recent common ancestor in the early 1980s. Determinants of adaptation
  in the capsid protein were studied using different maximum likelihood approaches
  to identify sites subject to diversifying or directional selection and sites that
  co-evolved. While a number of the computationally determined adaptively evolving
  sites were on the surface of the capsid and possible subject to immune selection,
  we also detected sites that were subject to constrained or compensatory evolution
  due to secondary RNA structures, relevant in virus-replication. We highlight codons
  that may prove useful in identifying emerging novel variants, and, using these,
  indicate that the novel 2008 variant is more likely to cause a future epidemic than
  the 2007 variant. While norovirus infections are generally mild and self-limiting,
  more severe outcomes of infection frequently occur in elderly and immunocompromized
  people, and no treatment is available. The observed pattern of continually emerging
  novel variants of GII.4, causing elevated numbers of infections, is therefore a
  cause for concern.
