abstract: 'Background: Recent advances in high-throughput molecular epidemiology are
  transforming the analysis of viral infections. Methods: Human immunodeficiency virus
  (HIV)-1 pol sequences from a Northern Californian cohort (NCC) of 4553 antiretroviral-naive
  individuals sampled between 1998 and 2016 were analyzed together with 140 000 previously
  published global pol sequences. The HIV-TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE)
  was used to infer a transmission network comprising links between NCC and previously
  published sequences having a genetic distance â‰¤1.5%. Results: Twenty-five percent
  of NCC sequences were included in 264 clusters linked to a published sequence, and
  approximately one third of these (8.0% of the total) were linked to 1 or more non-US
  sequences. The largest cluster, containing 512 NCC sequences (11.2% of the total),
  comprised the subtype B lineage that traced its origin to the earliest North American
  sequences. Approximately 5 percent of NCC sequences belonged to a non-B subtype,
  and these were more likely to cluster with a non-US sequence. Twenty-two NCC sequences
  belonged to 1 of 4 large clusters containing sequences from rapidly growing regional
  epidemics: CRF07_BC (East Asia), subtype A6 (former Soviet Union), a Japanese subtype
  B lineage, and an East/Southeast Asian CRF01_AE lineage. Bayesian phylogenetics
  suggested that most non-B sequences resulted from separate introductions but that
  local spread within the largest CRF01_AE cluster occurred twice. Conclusions: The
  NCC contains national and international links to previously published sequences
  including many to the subtype B strain that originated in North America and several
  to rapidly growing Asian epidemics. Despite their rapid regional growth, the Asian
  epidemic strains demonstrated limited NCC spread.'
