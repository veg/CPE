abstract:  * Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance has implications for
  antiretroviral treatment strategies and for containing the HIV pandemic because
  the development of HIV drug resistance leads to the requirement for antiretroviral
  drugs that may be less effective, less well-tolerated, and more expensive than those
  used in first-line regimens.  * HIV drug resistance studies are designed to determine
  which HIV mutations are selected by antiretroviral drugs and, in turn, how these
  mutations affect antiretroviral drug susceptibility and response to future antiretroviral
  treatment regimens.  * Such studies collectively form a vital knowledge base essential
  for monitoring global HIV drug resistance trends, interpreting HIV genotypic tests,
  and updating HIV treatment guidelines.  * Although HIV drug resistance data are
  collected in many studies, such data are often not publicly shared, prompting the
  need to recommend best practices to encourage and standardize HIV drug resistance
  data sharing.  * In contrast to other viruses, sharing HIV sequences from phylogenetic
  studies of transmission dynamics requires additional precautions as HIV transmission
  is criminalized in many countries and regions.  * Our recommendations are designed
  to ensure that the data that contribute to HIV drug resistance knowledge will be
  available without undue hardship to those publishing HIV drug resistance studies
  and without risk to people living with HIV.
