abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Compared to HIV monoinfection, HIV dual infection (DI) has been
  associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads. The same
  markers are also associated with the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive
  disorder (HAND), which continues to be a prevalent problem in the era of combination
  antiretroviral therapy (ART). We sought to determine the relationship between DI
  and HAND. METHODS: Participants on ART (N = 38) underwent deep sequencingoffour
  PCR-amplified HIVcoding regions derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
  DNA samples. Phylogenetic analyses were performedto evaluate whether two distinct
  viral lineages, i.e. DI, were present in the same individual. All study participants
  underwent neurocognitive, substance use, and neuromedical assessments at each study
  visit. RESULTS: Of 38 participants, 9 (23.7%) had evidence of DI. Using clinical
  ratings, global neurocognitive impairment was identified in 21 (55%) participants,
  and multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between DI and
  impairment;OR (95%CI) = 18.3 (1.9,414.2), p = 0.028. Neurocognitive impairment was
  also associated with lower current (p = 0.028) and nadir (p = 0.043) CD4 T-cell
  counts. CONCLUSIONS: Deep sequencing of HIV DNA populations in PBMC identified DI
  in nearly a quarter ofHIV-infected adultsreceiving ART, and DI was associated with
  HAND. Dual infection may contribute to the development of HAND, perhaps due to increased
  viral diversity. Further investigation is needed to determine how DI results in
  worse neurocognitive performance.'
