abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections spread across contact networks.
  Partner elicitation and notification are commonly used public health tools to identify,
  notify, and offer testing to persons linked in these contact networks. For HIV-1,
  a rapidly evolving pathogen with low per-contact transmission rates, viral genetic
  sequences are an additional source of data that can be used to infer or refine transmission
  networks. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The New York City Department of Health and Mental
  Hygiene interviews individuals newly diagnosed with HIV and elicits names of sexual
  and injection drug using partners. By law, the Department of Health also receives
  HIV sequences when these individuals enter healthcare and their physicians order
  resistance testing. Our study used both HIV sequence and partner naming data from
  1342 HIV-infected persons in New York City between 2006 and 2012 to infer and compare
  sexual/drug-use named partner and genetic transmission networks. Using these networks,
  we determined a range of genetic distance thresholds suitable for identifying potential
  transmission partners. In 48% of cases, named partners were infected with genetically
  closely related viruses, compatible with but not necessarily representing or implying,
  direct transmission. Partner pairs linked through the genetic similarity of their
  HIV sequences were also linked by naming in 53% of cases. Persons who reported high-risk
  heterosexual contact were more likely to name at least one partner with a genetically
  similar virus than those reporting their risk as injection drug use or men who have
  sex with men. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed an unprecedentedly large and detailed partner
  tracing and HIV sequence dataset and determined an empirically justified range of
  genetic distance thresholds for identifying potential transmission partners. We
  conclude that genetic linkage provides more reliable evidence for identifying potential
  transmission partners than partner naming, highlighting the importance and complementarity
  of both epidemiological and molecular genetic surveillance for characterizing regional
  HIV-1 epidemics.'
