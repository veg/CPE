abstract: Due to the stringent population bottleneck that occurs during sexual HIV-1
  transmission, systemic infection is typically established by a limited number of
  founder viruses. Elucidation of the precise forces influencing the selection of
  founder viruses may reveal key vulnerabilities that could aid in the development
  of a vaccine or other clinical interventions. Here, we utilize deep sequencing data
  and apply a genetic distance-based method to investigate whether the mode of sexual
  transmission shapes the nascent founder viral genome. Analysis of 74 acute and early
  HIV-1 infected subjects revealed that 83% of men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit
  a single founder virus, levels similar to those previously observed in heterosexual
  (HSX) transmission. In a metadata analysis of a total of 354 subjects, including
  HSX, MSM and injecting drug users (IDU), we also observed no significant differences
  in the frequency of single founder virus infections between HSX and MSM transmissions.
  However, comparison of HIV-1 envelope sequences revealed that HSX founder viruses
  exhibited a greater number of codon sites under positive selection, as well as stronger
  transmission indices possibly reflective of higher fitness variants. Moreover, specific
  genetic \"signatures\" within MSM and HSX founder viruses were identified, with
  single polymorphisms within gp41 enriched among HSX viruses while more complex patterns,
  including clustered polymorphisms surrounding the CD4 binding site, were enriched
  in MSM viruses. While our findings do not support an influence of the mode of sexual
  transmission on the number of founder viruses, they do demonstrate that there are
  marked differences in the selection bottleneck that can significantly shape their
  genetic composition. This study illustrates the complex dynamics of the transmission
  bottleneck and reveals that distinct genetic bottleneck processes exist dependent
  upon the mode of HIV-1 transmission.
