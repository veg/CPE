 abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the approval of the HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, capsid sequencing will be required for managing lenacapavir-experienced individuals with detectable viremia. Successful sequence interpretation will require examining new capsid sequences in the context of previously published sequence data.
METHODS: We analyzed published HIV-1 group M capsid sequences from 21,012 capsid-inhibitor naı̈ve individuals to characterize amino acid variability at each position and influence of subtype and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) selection pressure. We determined the distributions of usual mutations, defined as amino acid differences from the group M consensus, with a prevalence ≥ 0.1%. Co-evolving mutations were identified using a phylogenetically-informed Bayesian graphical model method.
RESULTS: 162 (70.1%) positions had no usual mutations (45.9%) or only conservative usual mutations with a positive BLOSUM62 score (24.2%). Variability correlated independently with subtype-specific amino acid occurrence (Spearman rho = 0.83; p < 1 × 10-9) and the number of times positions were reported to contain an HLA-associated polymorphism, an indicator of CTL pressure (rho = 0.43; p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the distribution of usual capsid mutations is essential for sequence quality control. Comparing capsid sequences from lenacapavir-treated and lenacapavir-na\̈ve individuals will enable the identification of additional mutations potentially associated with lenacapavir therapy.},
