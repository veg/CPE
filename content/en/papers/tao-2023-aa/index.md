abstract: 'BACKGROUND: With the approval of the HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir,
  capsid sequencing will be required for managing lenacapavir-experienced individuals
  with detectable viremia. Successful sequence interpretation will require examining
  new capsid sequences in the context of previously published sequence data. METHODS:
  We analyzed published HIV-1 group M capsid sequences from 21,012 capsid-inhibitor
  naı̈ve individuals to characterize amino acid variability at each position and influence
  of subtype and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) selection pressure. We determined the
  distributions of usual mutations, defined as amino acid differences from the group
  M consensus, with a prevalence ≥ 0.1%. Co-evolving mutations were identified using
  a phylogenetically-informed Bayesian graphical model method. RESULTS: 162 (70.1%)
  positions had no usual mutations (45.9%) or only conservative usual mutations with
  a positive BLOSUM62 score (24.2%). Variability correlated independently with subtype-specific
  amino acid occurrence (Spearman rho = 0.83; p < 1 × 10-9) and the number of times
  positions were reported to contain an HLA-associated polymorphism, an indicator
  of CTL pressure (rho = 0.43; p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the distribution
  of usual capsid mutations is essential for sequence quality control. Comparing capsid
  sequences from lenacapavir-treated and lenacapavir-näve individuals will enable
  the identification of additional mutations potentially associated with lenacapavir
  therapy.'
