abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the susceptibilities to and consequences of HIV-1
  dual infection. DESIGN: We compared clinical, virologic, and immunologic factors
  between participants who were dually infected with HIV-1 subtype B and monoinfected
  controls who were matched by ongoing HIV risk factor. METHODS: The viral load and
  CD4 progressions of dually and singly infected participant groups were compared
  with linear mixed-effects models, and individual dynamics before and after superinfection
  were assessed with a structural change test (Chow test). Recombination breakpoint
  analysis (GARD), HLA frequency analysis, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope
  mapping were also performed (HIV LANL Database). RESULTS: The viral loads of dually
  infected participants increased more over 3 years of follow-up than the viral loads
  of monoinfected controls, whereas CD4 progressions of the two groups did not differ.
  Viral escape from CTL responses following superinfection was observed in two participants
  whose superinfecting strain completely replaced the initial strain. This pattern
  was not seen among participants whose superinfecting virus persisted in a recombinant
  form with the initial virus or was only detected transiently. Several HLA types
  were over-represented in dually infected participants as compared to monoinfected
  controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify potential factors for dual infection
  susceptibility and further define its clinical consequences.'
