abstract: 'Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of serious and often fatal infections,
  is well-armed with secreted factors that disarm host immune defenses. Highly expressed
  in vivo during infection, Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is reported to also contribute
  to nasal colonization that can be a prelude to invasive infection. Co-evolution
  with the host immune system has provided SpA with an Fc-antibody binding site, and
  a Fab-binding site responsible for non-immune superantigen interactions via germline-encoded
  surfaces expressed on many human BCRs. We wondered whether the recurrent exposures
  to S. aureus commonly experienced by adults, result in the accumulation of memory
  B-cell responses to other determinants on SpA. We therefore isolated SpA-specific
  class-switched memory B cells, and characterized their encoding VH : VL antibody
  genes. In SpA-reactive memory B cells, we confirmed a striking bias in usage for
  VH genes, which retain the surface that mediates the SpA-superantigen interaction.
  We postulate these interactions reflect co-evolution of the host immune system and
  SpA, which during infection results in immune recruitment of an extraordinarily
  high prevalence of B cells in the repertoire that subverts the augmentation of protective
  defenses. Herein, we provide the first evidence that human memory responses are
  supplemented by B-cell clones, and circulating-antibodies, that bind to SpA determinants
  independent of the non-immune Fc- and Fab-binding sites. In parallel, we demonstrate
  that healthy individuals, and patients recovering from S. aureus infection, both
  have circulating antibodies with these conventional binding specificities. These
  findings rationalize the potential utility of incorporating specially engineered
  SpA proteins into a protective vaccine.'
