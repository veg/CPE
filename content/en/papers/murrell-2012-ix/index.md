abstract: The evolution of substitutions conferring drug resistance to HIV-1 is both
  episodic, occurring when patients are on antiretroviral therapy, and strongly directional,
  with site-specific resistant residues increasing in frequency over time. While methods
  exist to detect episodic diversifying selection and continuous directional selection,
  no evolutionary model combining these two properties has been proposed. We present
  two models of episodic directional selection (MEDS and EDEPS) which allow the a
  priori specification of lineages expected to have undergone directional selection.
  The models infer the sites and target residues that were likely subject to directional
  selection, using either codon or protein sequences. Compared to its null model of
  episodic diversifying selection, MEDS provides a superior fit to most sites known
  to be involved in drug resistance, and neither one test for episodic diversifying
  selection nor another for constant directional selection are able to detect as many
  true positives as MEDS and EDEPS while maintaining acceptable levels of false positives.
  This suggests that episodic directional selection is a better description of the
  process driving the evolution of drug resistance.
