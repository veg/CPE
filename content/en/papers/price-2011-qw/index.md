abstract: To characterize WHO-defined transmitted HIV drug resistance mutation (TDRM)
  data from recently HIV-infected African volunteers, we sequenced HIV (pol) and evaluated
  for TDRM the earliest available specimens from ARV-naive volunteers diagnosed within
  1 year of their estimated date of infection at eight research centers in sub-Saharan
  Africa. TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied
  by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in
  Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had
  TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection
  in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire
  study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available;
  3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data
  available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the
  newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability
  throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should
  be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform
  to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices,
  and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission.
