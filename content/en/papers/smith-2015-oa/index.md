abstract: Over the past two decades, comparative sequence analysis using codon-substitution
  models has been honed into a powerful and popular approach for detecting signatures
  of natural selection from molecular data. A substantial body of work has focused
  on developing a class of \"branch-site\" models which permit selective pressures
  on sequences, quantified by the ω ratio, to vary among both codon sites and individual
  branches in the phylogeny. We develop and present a method in this class, adaptive
  branch-site random effects likelihood (aBSREL), whose key innovation is variable
  parametric complexity chosen with an information theoretic criterion. By applying
  models of different complexity to different branches in the phylogeny, aBSREL delivers
  statistical performance matching or exceeding best-in-class existing approaches,
  while running an order of magnitude faster. Based on simulated data analysis, we
  offer guidelines for what extent and strength of diversifying positive selection
  can be detected reliably and suggest that there is a natural limit on the optimal
  parametric complexity for \"branch-site\" models. An aBSREL analysis of 8,893 Euteleostomes
  gene alignments demonstrates that over 80% of branches in typical gene phylogenies
  can be adequately modeled with a single ω ratio model, that is, current models are
  unnecessarily complicated. However, there are a relatively small number of key branches,
  whose identities are derived from the data using a model selection procedure, for
  which it is essential to accurately model evolutionary complexity.
