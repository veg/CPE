abstract: For the first time, we describe phylogenomic signatures of an epidemic lineage
  of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV). We applied multiple evolutionary analyses
  to a dataset of 87 full-length genome sequences representing the circulation of
  an epidemic VSIV lineage in the US between 2019 and 2020. Based on phylogenetic
  analyses, we predicted the ancestral relationship of this lineage with a specific
  group of isolates circulating in the endemic zone of Chiapas, Mexico. Subsequently,
  our findings indicate that the lineage diversified into at least four different
  subpopulations during its circulation in the US. We identified single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate viral subpopulations and assessed their
  potential relevance using comparative phylogenetic methods, highlighting the preponderance
  of synonymous mutations during the differentiation of these populations. Purifying
  selection was the main evolutionary force favoring the conservation of this epidemic
  phenotype, with P and G genes as the main drivers of the evolution of this lineage.
  Our analyses identified multiple codon sites under positive selection and the association
  of these sites with specific functional domains at P, M, G, and L proteins. Based
  on ancestral reconstruction analyses, we showed the potential relevance of some
  of the sites identified under positive selection to the adaptation of the epidemic
  lineage at the population level. Finally, using a representative group of viruses
  from Colorado, we established a positive correlation between genetic and geographical
  distances, suggesting that positive selection on specific codon positions might
  have favored the adaptation of different subpopulations to circulation in specific
  geographical settings. Collectively, our study reveals the complex dynamics that
  accompany the evolution of an epidemic lineage of VSIV in nature. Our analytical
  framework provides a model for conducting future evolutionary analyses. The ultimate
  goal is to support the implementation of an early warning system for vesicular stomatitis
  virus in the US, enabling early detection of epidemic precursors from Mexico.
