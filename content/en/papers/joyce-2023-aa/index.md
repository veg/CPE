abstract: Vaccination strategies aimed at maturing broadly neutralizing antibodies
  (bnAbs) from naı̈ve precursors are hindered by unusual features that characterize
  these Abs, including insertions and deletions (indels). Longitudinal studies of
  natural HIV infection cases shed light on the complex processes underlying bnAb
  development and have suggested a role for superinfection as a potential enhancer
  of neutralization breadth. Here we describe the development of a potent bnAb lineage
  that was elicited by two founder viruses to inform vaccine design. The V3-glycan
  targeting bnAb lineage (PC39-1) was isolated from subtype C-infected IAVI Protocol
  C elite neutralizer, donor PC39, and is defined by the presence of multiple independent
  insertions in CDRH1 that range from 1-11 amino acids in length. Memory B cell members
  of this lineage are predominantly atypical in phenotype yet also span the class-switched
  and antibody-secreting cell compartments. Development of neutralization breadth
  occurred concomitantly with extensive recombination between founder viruses before
  each virus separated into two distinct population \"arms\" that evolved independently
  to escape the PC39-1 lineage. Ab crystal structures show an extended CDRH1 that
  can help stabilize the CDRH3. Overall, these findings suggest that early exposure
  of the humoral system to multiple related Env molecules could promote the induction
  of bnAbs by focusing Ab responses to conserved epitopes.
