abstract: The past several months have witnessed the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants
  with novel spike protein mutations that are influencing the epidemiological and
  clinical aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants can increase rates of
  virus transmission and/or increase the risk of reinfection and reduce the protection
  afforded by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and vaccination. These variants can
  therefore enable SARS-CoV-2 to continue its spread in the face of rising population
  immunity while maintaining or increasing its replication fitness. The identification
  of four rapidly expanding virus lineages since December 2020, designated variants
  of concern, has ushered in a new stage of the pandemic. The four variants of concern,
  the Alpha variant (originally identified in the UK), the Beta variant (originally
  identified in South Africa), the Gamma variant (originally identified in Brazil)
  and the Delta variant (originally identified in India), share several mutations
  with one another as well as with an increasing number of other recently identified
  SARS-CoV-2 variants. Collectively, these SARS-CoV-2 variants complicate the COVID-19
  research agenda and necessitate additional avenues of laboratory, epidemiological
  and clinical research.
