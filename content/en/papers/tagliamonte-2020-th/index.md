abstract: Our evolutionary and structural analyses revealed that the severe acute
  respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike gene is a complex mosaic
  resulting from several recombination events. Additionally, the fixation of variants
  has mainly been driven by purifying selection, suggesting the presence of conserved
  structural features. Our dynamic simulations identified two main long-range covariant
  dynamic movements of the novel glycoprotein, and showed that, as a result of the
  evolutionary duality, they are preserved. The first movement involves the receptor
  binding domain with the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain 2 and is maintained
  across human, bat and pangolin coronaviruses. The second is a complex network of
  long-range dynamics specific to SARS-CoV-2 involving the novel PRRA and the conserved
  KR*SF cleavage sites, as well as conserved segments in C-terminal domain 3. These
  movements, essential for host cell binding, are maintained by hinges conserved across
  human, bat, and pangolin coronaviruses glycoproteins. The hinges, located around
  Threonine 333 and Proline 527 within the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain
  2, represent candidate targets for the future development of novel pan-coronavirus
  inhibitors. In summary, we show that while recombination created a new configuration
  that increased the covariant dynamic movements of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein, negative
  selection preserved its inter-domain structure throughout evolution in different
  hosts and inter-species transmissions.
