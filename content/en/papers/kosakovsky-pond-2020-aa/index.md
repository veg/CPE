abstract: A number of evolutionary hypotheses can be tested by comparing selective
  pressures among sets of branches in a phylogenetic tree. When the question of interest
  is to identify specific sites within genes that may be evolving differently, a common
  approach is to perform separate analyses on subsets of sequences, and compare parameter
  estimates in a post hoc fashion. This approach is statistically suboptimal, and
  not always applicable. Here, we develop a simple extension of a popular fixed effects
  likelihood method in the context of codon-based evolutionary phylogenetic maximum
  likelihood testing, Contrast-FEL. It is suitable for identifying individual alignment
  sites where any among the K ≥ 2 sets of branches in a phylogenetic tree have detectably
  different ω ratios, indicative of different selective regimes. Using extensive simulations,
  we show that Contrast-FEL delivers good power, exceeding 90% for sufficiently large
  differences, while maintaining tight control over false positive rates, when the
  model is correctly specified. We conclude by applying Contrast-FEL to data from
  five previously published studies spanning a diverse range of organisms and focusing
  on different evolutionary questions.
