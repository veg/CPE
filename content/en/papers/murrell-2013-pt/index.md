abstract: 'Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a
  relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these
  classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters,
  which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present
  an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over
  a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection
  parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive
  and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing
  methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce
  misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different
  levels of positive or purifying selection--an unavoidable scenario when using a
  small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR)
  is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained
  (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze
  larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin
  data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest
  HyPhy distribution (http://www.hyphy.org), as well as on the Datamonkey web server
  (http://www.datamonkey.org/).'
