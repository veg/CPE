abstract: "Mutations in four of the ten human small heat shock proteins (sHSP) are\
  \ associated with various forms of motor neuropathies and myopathies. In HspB1,\
  \ HspB3, and HspB8 all known mutations cause motor neuropathies, whereas in HspB5\
  \ they cause myopathies. Several features are common to the majority of these mutations:\
  \ (i) they are missense mutations, (ii) most associated disease phenotypes exhibit\
  \ a dominant inheritance pattern and late disease onset, (iii) in the primary protein\
  \ sequences, the sites of most mutations are located in the conserved Î±-crystallin\
  \ domain and the variable C-terminal extensions, and (iv) most human mutation sites\
  \ are highly conserved among the vertebrate orthologs and have been historically\
  \ exposed to significant purifying selection. In contrast, a minor fraction of these\
  \ mutations deviate from these rules: they are (i) frame shifting, nonsense, or\
  \ elongation mutations, (ii) associated with recessive or early onset disease phenotypes,\
  \ (iii) positioned in the N-terminal domain of the proteins, and (iv) less conserved\
  \ among the vertebrates and were historically not subject to a strong selective\
  \ pressure. In several vertebrate sHSPs (including primate sHSPs), homologous sites\
  \ differ from the human sequence and occasionally even encode the same amino acid\
  \ residues that cause the disease in humans. Apparently, a number of these mutations\
  \ sites are not crucial for the protein function in single species or entire taxa,\
  \ and single species even seem to have adopted mechanisms that compensate for potentially\
  \ adverse effects of 'mutant-like' sHSPs. The disease-associated dominant sHSP missense\
  \ mutations have a number of cellular consequences that are consistent with gain-of-function\
  \ mechanisms of genetic dominance: dominant-negative effects, the formation of cytotoxic\
  \ amyloid protein oligomers and precipitates, disruption of cytoskeletal networks,\
  \ and increased downstream enzymatic activities. Future therapeutic concepts should\
  \ aim for reducing these adverse effects of mutant sHSPs in patients. Indeed, initial\
  \ experimental results are encouraging."
