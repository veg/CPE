abstract: 'Synonymous codon substitutions are not always selectively neutral as revealed
  by several types of analyses, including studies of codon usage patterns among genes.
  We analyzed codon usage in 13 bacterial genomes sampled from across a large order
  of bacteria, Enterobacterales, and identified presumptively neutral and selected
  classes of synonymous substitutions. To estimate substitution rates, given a neutral/selected
  classification of synonymous substitutions, we developed a flexible [Formula: see
  text] substitution model that allows multiple classes of synonymous substitutions.
  Under this multiclass synonymous substitution (MSS) model, the denominator of [Formula:
  see text] includes only the strictly neutral class of synonymous substitutions.
  On average, the value of [Formula: see text] under the MSS model was 80% of that
  under the standard codon model in which all synonymous substitutions are assumed
  to be neutral. The indication is that conventional [Formula: see text] analyses
  overestimate these values and thus overestimate the frequency of positive diversifying
  selection and underestimate the strength of purifying selection. To quantify the
  strength of selection necessary to explain this reduction, we developed a model
  of selected compensatory codon substitutions. The reduction in synonymous substitution
  rate, and thus the contribution that selection makes to codon bias variation among
  genes, can be adequately explained by very weak selection, with a mean product of
  population size and selection coefficient, [Formula: see text].'
