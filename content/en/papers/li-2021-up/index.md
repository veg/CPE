abstract: 'Background: The human norovirus GII.2 outbreak during the 2016-2017 winter
  season was of unprecedented scale and geographic distribution. Methods: We analyzed
  519 complete VP1 gene sequences of the human norovirus GII.2 genotype sampled during
  the 2016-2017 winter season, as well as prior (dating back to 1976) from 7 countries.
  Phylodynamic analyses of these sequences were performed using maximum likelihood
  and Bayesian statistical frameworks in order to estimate viral evolutionary and
  population dynamics associated with the outbreak. Results: Our results revealed
  an increase in the genetic diversity of human norovirus GII.2 during the recent
  Asian outbreak and diversification was characterized by at least eight distinct
  clusters. Bayesian estimation of viral population dynamics revealed a highly fluctuating
  effective population size, increasing in frequency during the past 15 years. Conclusion:
  Despite an increasing viral diversity, we found no evidence of an elevated evolutionary
  rate or significant selection pressure in human norovirus GII.2, indicating viral
  evolutionary adaptation was not responsible for the volatility of or spread of the
  virus during this time.'
