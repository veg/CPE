abstract: 'Background.: Investigations into which human immunodeficiency virus type
  1 (HIV-1) sequence features may be selected for transmission during sexual exposure
  have been hampered by the small number of characterized transmission pairs in individual
  studies. Methods.: To boost statistical power to detect differences in glycosylation,
  length, and electrical charge in the HIV-1 V1-V4 coding region, we reanalyzed all
  available 2485 env sequences derived from 114 subjects representing 58 transmission
  pairs from previous studies using mixed-effects linear regression and an approach
  to approximate the unobserved transmitted virus. Results.: The recipient partner
  had a shorter V1-V4 region and fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS)
  than sequences from the source partner. We also detected a trend toward more PNGS
  and lower isoelectric points in transmitted sequences with source partner and the
  evolutionary tendency to shorten V1-V4 sequences, reduce the number of PNGS, and
  lower isoelectric points in the recipient following transmission. Conclusions.:
  By using all available well-characterized env sequences from transmission pairs
  via sexual exposure, we were able to identify several important virologic factors
  that may be important in the development of biomedical preventive interventions.'
