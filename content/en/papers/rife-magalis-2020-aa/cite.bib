 abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a rapidly evolving virus, allowing its genetic sequence to act as a fingerprint for epidemiological processes among, as well as within, individual infected hosts. Though primarily infecting the CD4+ T-cell population, HIV can also be found in monocytes, an immune cell population that differs in several aspects from the canonical T-cell viral target. Using single genome viral sequencing and statistical phylogenetic inference, we investigated the viral RNA diversity and relative contribution of each of these immune cell types to the viral population within the peripheral blood. Results provide evidence of an increased prevalence of circulating monocytes harboring virus in individuals with high viral load in the absence of suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Bayesian phyloanatomic analysis of three of these individuals demonstrated a measurable role for these cells, but not the circulating T-cell population, as a source of cell-free virus in the plasma, supporting the hypothesis that these cells can act as an additional conduit of virus spread.},
