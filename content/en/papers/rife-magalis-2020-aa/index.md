abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a rapidly evolving virus, allowing
  its genetic sequence to act as a fingerprint for epidemiological processes among,
  as well as within, individual infected hosts. Though primarily infecting the CD4+
  T-cell population, HIV can also be found in monocytes, an immune cell population
  that differs in several aspects from the canonical T-cell viral target. Using single
  genome viral sequencing and statistical phylogenetic inference, we investigated
  the viral RNA diversity and relative contribution of each of these immune cell types
  to the viral population within the peripheral blood. Results provide evidence of
  an increased prevalence of circulating monocytes harboring virus in individuals
  with high viral load in the absence of suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Bayesian
  phyloanatomic analysis of three of these individuals demonstrated a measurable role
  for these cells, but not the circulating T-cell population, as a source of cell-free
  virus in the plasma, supporting the hypothesis that these cells can act as an additional
  conduit of virus spread.
