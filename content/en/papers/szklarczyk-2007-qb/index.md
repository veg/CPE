abstract: "INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus encodes two protein products, INK4a and\
  \ ARF, essential for controlling tumorigenesis and mutated in more than half of\
  \ human cancers. There is no resemblance between the two proteins: their coding\
  \ regions are assembled by alternative splicing of two mutually exclusive 5' exons\
  \ into a constitutive one containing overlapping out-of-phase reading frames. We\
  \ show that the dual-coding arrangement conflicts with the high cost of mutations\
  \ within INK4a/ARF. Unexpectedly, the locus evolves rapidly and asymmetrically,\
  \ with ARF accumulating the majority of amino acid replacements. Rapid evolution\
  \ drives both INK4a and ARF proteins out of sync with other members of the RB and\
  \ p53 tumor suppressor pathways, both of which are controlled by the locus. Yet,\
  \ the asymmetric behavior may be an intrinsic property of dual-coding exons: INK4a/ARF\
  \ closely mimics the evolution of 90 newly identified genes with similar dual-coding\
  \ structure. Thus, the strong link between mutations in INK4a/ARF and cancer may\
  \ be a direct consequence of the architecture of the locus."
