abstract: 'hyphy (HYpothesis testing using PHYlogenies) is a scriptable, open-source
  package for fitting a broad range of evolutionary models to multiple sequence alignments,
  and for conducting subsequent parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, primarily
  in the maximum likelihood statistical framework. It has become a popular choice
  for characterizing various aspects of the evolutionary process: natural selection,
  evolutionary rates, recombination, and coevolution. The 2.5 release (available from
  www.hyphy.org) includes a completely re-engineered computational core and analysis
  library that introduces new classes of evolutionary models and statistical tests,
  delivers substantial performance and stability enhancements, improves usability,
  streamlines end-to-end analysis workflows, makes it easier to develop custom analyses,
  and is mostly backwards compatible with previous HyPhy releases.'
