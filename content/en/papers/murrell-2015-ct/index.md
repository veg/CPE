abstract: We present BUSTED, a new approach to identifying gene-wide evidence of episodic
  positive selection, where the non-synonymous substitution rate is transiently greater
  than the synonymous rate. BUSTED can be used either on an entire phylogeny (without
  requiring an a priori hypothesis regarding which branches are under positive selection)
  or on a pre-specified subset of foreground lineages (if a suitable a priori hypothesis
  is available). Selection is modeled as varying stochastically over branches and
  sites, and we propose a computationally inexpensive evidence metric for identifying
  sites subject to episodic positive selection on any foreground branches. We compare
  BUSTED with existing models on simulated and empirical data. An implementation is
  available on www.datamonkey.org/busted, with a widget allowing the interactive specification
  of foreground branches.
