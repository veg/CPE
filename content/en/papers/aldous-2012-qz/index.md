abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clinically, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pol
  sequences are used to evaluate for drug resistance. These data can also be used
  to evaluate transmission networks and help describe factors associated with transmission
  risk. METHODS: HIV-1 pol sequences from participants at 5 sites in the CFAR Network
  of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort from 2000-2009 were analyzed for genetic
  relatedness. Only the first available sequence per participant was included. Inferred
  transmission networks (\"clusters\") were defined as ≥2 sequences with ≤1.5% genetic
  distance. Clusters including ≥3 patients (\"networks\") were evaluated for clinical
  and demographic associations. RESULTS: Of 3697 sequences, 24% fell into inferred
  clusters: 155 clusters of 2 individuals (\"dyads\"), 54 clusters that included 3-14
  individuals (\"networks\"), and 1 large cluster that included 336 individuals across
  all study sites. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with being in a cluster
  included not using antiretroviral (ARV) drugs at time of sampling (P < .001), sequence
  collected after 2004 (P < .001), CD4 cell count >350 cells/mL (P < .01), and viral
  load 10,000-100,000 copies/mL (P < .001) or >100,000 copies/mL (P < .001). In networks,
  women were more likely to cluster with other women (P < .001), and African Americans
  with other African Americans (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular epidemiology can
  be applied to study HIV transmission networks in geographically and demographically
  diverse cohorts. Clustering was associated with lack of ARV use and higher viral
  load, implying transmission may be interrupted by earlier diagnosis and treatment.
  Observed female and African American networks reinforce the importance of diagnosis
  and prevention efforts targeted by sex and race.'
