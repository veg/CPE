abstract: 'Coding of multiple proteins by overlapping reading frames is not a feature
  one would associate with eukaryotic genes. Indeed, codependency between codons of
  overlapping protein-coding regions imposes a unique set of evolutionary constraints,
  making it a costly arrangement. Yet in cases of tightly coexpressed interacting
  proteins, dual coding may be advantageous. Here we show that although dual coding
  is nearly impossible by chance, a number of human transcripts contain overlapping
  coding regions. Using newly developed statistical techniques, we identified 40 candidate
  genes with evolutionarily conserved overlapping coding regions. Because our approach
  is conservative, we expect mammals to possess more dual-coding genes. Our results
  emphasize that the skepticism surrounding eukaryotic dual coding is unwarranted:
  rather than being artifacts, overlapping reading frames are often hallmarks of fascinating
  biology.'
