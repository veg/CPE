abstract: Interferon alpha (IFNA) genes code for proteins with important signaling
  roles during the innate immune response. Phylogenetically, IFNA family members in
  eutherians (placental mammals) cluster together in a species-specific manner except
  for closely related species (i.e. Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes) where gene-specific
  clustering is evident. Previous research has been unable to clarify whether gene
  conversion or recent gene duplication accounts for gene-specific clustering, partly
  because the similarity of members of the IFNA family within species has made it
  historically difficult to identify the exact composition of IFNA gene families.
  IFNA gene families were fully characterized in recently available genomes from Canis
  familiaris, Macaca mulatta, P. troglodytes and Rattus norvegicus, and combined with
  previously characterized IFNA gene families from H. sapiens and Mus musculus, for
  the analysis of both whole and partial gene conversion events using a variety of
  statistical methods. Gene conversion was inferred in every eutherian species analyzed
  and comparison of the IFNA gene family locus between primate species revealed independent
  gene duplication in M. mulatta. Thus, both gene conversion and gene duplication
  have shaped the evolution of the IFNA gene family in eutherian species. Scenarios
  may be envisaged whereby the increased production of a specific IFN-alpha protein
  would be beneficial against a particular pathogenic infection. Gene conversion,
  similar to duplication, provides a mechanism by which the protein product of a specific
  IFNA gene can be increased.
