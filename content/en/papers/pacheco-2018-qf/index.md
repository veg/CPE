abstract: "Haemosporidians are a diverse group of vector-borne parasitic protozoa\
  \ that includes the agents of human malaria; however, most of the described species\
  \ are found in birds and reptiles. Although our understanding of these parasites'\
  \ diversity has expanded by analyses of their mitochondrial genes, there is limited\
  \ information on these genes' evolutionary rates. Here, 114 mitochondrial genomes\
  \ (mtDNA) were studied from species belonging to four genera: Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus,\
  \ Hepatocystis, and Plasmodium. Contrary to previous assertions, the mtDNA is phylogenetically\
  \ informative. The inferred phylogeny showed that, like the genus Plasmodium, the\
  \ Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus genera are not monophyletic groups. Although sensitive\
  \ to the assumptions of the molecular dating method used, the estimated times indicate\
  \ that the diversification of the avian haemosporidian subgenera/genera took place\
  \ after the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary following the radiation of modern birds.\
  \ Furthermore, parasite clade differences in mtDNA substitution rates and strength\
  \ of negative selection were detected. These differences may affect the biological\
  \ interpretation of mtDNA gene lineages used as a proxy to species in ecological\
  \ and parasitological investigations. Given that the mitochondria are critically\
  \ important in the parasite life cycle stages that take place in the vector and\
  \ that the transmission of parasites belonging to particular clades has been linked\
  \ to specific insect families/subfamilies, this study suggests that differences\
  \ in vectors have affected the mode of evolution of haemosporidian mtDNA genes.\
  \ The observed patterns also suggest that the radiation of haemosporidian parasites\
  \ may be the result of community-level evolutionary processes between their vertebrate\
  \ and invertebrate hosts."
