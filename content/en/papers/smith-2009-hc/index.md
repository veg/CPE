abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Current public health efforts often use molecular technologies
  to identify and contain communicable disease networks, but not for HIV. Here, we
  investigate how molecular epidemiology can be used to identify highly related HIV
  networks within a population and how voluntary contact tracing of sexual partners
  can be used to selectively target these networks. METHODS: We evaluated the use
  of HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from participants of a community-recruited cohort
  (n = 268) and a primary infection research cohort (n = 369) to define highly related
  transmission clusters and the use of contact tracing to link other individuals (n
  = 36) within these clusters. The presence of transmitted drug resistance was interpreted
  from the pol sequences (Calibrated Population Resistance v3.0). RESULTS: Phylogenetic
  clustering was conservatively defined when the genetic distance between any two
  pol sequences was less than 1%, which identified 34 distinct transmission clusters
  within the combined community-recruited and primary infection research cohorts containing
  160 individuals. Although sequences from the epidemiologically linked partners represented
  approximately 5% of the total sequences, they clustered with 60% of the sequences
  that clustered from the combined cohorts (odds ratio 21.7; P < or = 0.01). Major
  resistance to at least one class of antiretroviral medication was found in 19% of
  clustering sequences. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic methods can be used to identify individuals
  who are within highly related transmission groups, and contact tracing of epidemiologically
  linked partners of recently infected individuals can be used to link into previously
  defined transmission groups. These methods could be used to implement selectively
  targeted prevention interventions.'
