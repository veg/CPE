abstract: It is standard practice to model site-to-site variability of substitution
  rates by discretizing a continuous distribution into a small number, K, of equiprobable
  rate categories. We demonstrate that the variance of this discretized distribution
  has an upper bound determined solely by the choice of K and the mean of the distribution.
  This bound can introduce biases into statistical inference, especially when estimating
  parameters governing site-to-site variability of substitution rates. Applications
  to two large collections of sequence alignments demonstrate that this upper bound
  is often reached in analyses of real data. When parameter estimation is of primary
  interest, additional rate categories or more flexible modeling methods should be
  considered.
