abstract: Most methods for detecting Darwinian natural selection at the molecular
  level rely on estimating the rates or numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes
  in an alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences. In some of these methods, the nonsynonymous
  rate of substitution is allowed to vary across the sequence, permitting the identification
  of single amino acid positions that are under positive natural selection. However,
  it is unclear which probability distribution should be used to describe how the
  nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across the sequence. One widely used solution
  is to model variation in the nonsynonymous rate across the sequence as a mixture
  of several discrete or continuous probability distributions. Unfortunately, there
  is little population genetics theory to inform us of the appropriate probability
  distribution for among-site variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution.
  Here, we describe an approach to modeling variation in the nonsynonymous rate of
  substitution by using a Dirichlet process mixture model. The Dirichlet process allows
  there to be a countably infinite number of nonsynonymous rate classes and is very
  flexible in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous
  rate of substitution. We implemented the model in a fully Bayesian approach, with
  all parameters of the model considered as random variables.
