abstract: 'Standard methods used to estimate HIV-1 population diversity are often
  resource intensive (e.g., single genome amplification, clonal amplification and
  pyrosequencing) and not well suited for large study cohorts. Additional approaches
  are needed to address the relationships between intraindividual HIV-1 genetic diversity
  and 2 disease. With a small cohort of individuals, we validated three methods for
  measuring diversity: Shannon entropy and average pairwise distance (APD) using single
  genome sequences, and counts of mixed bases (i.e. ambiguous nucleotides) from population
  based sequences. In a large cohort, we then used the mixed base approach to determine
  associations between measure HIV-1 diversity and HIV associated disease. Normalized
  counts of mixed bases correlated with Shannon Entropy at both the nucleotide (rho=0.72,
  p=0.002) and amino acid level (rho=0.59, p=0.015), and APD (rho=0.75, p=0.001).
  Among participants who underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessments (n=187),
  increased HIV-1 population diversity was associated with both a diagnosis of AIDS
  and neuropsychological impairment.'
