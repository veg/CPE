abstract: DIVEIN is a web interface that performs automated phylogenetic and other
  analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Starting with a set of aligned
  sequences, DIVEIN estimates evolutionary parameters and phylogenetic trees while
  allowing the user to choose from a variety of evolutionary models; it then reconstructs
  the consensus (CON), most recent common ancestor (MRCA), and center of tree (COT)
  sequences. DIVEIN also provides tools for further analyses, including condensing
  sequence alignments to show only informative sites or private mutations; computing
  phylogenetic or pairwise divergence from any user-specified sequence (CON, MRCA,
  COT, or existing sequence from the alignment); computing and outputting all genetic
  distances in column format; calculating summary statistics of diversity and divergence
  from pairwise distances; and graphically representing the inferred tree and plots
  of divergence, diversity, and distance distribution histograms. DIVEIN is available
  at http://indra.mullins.microbiol.washington.edu/DIVEIN.
