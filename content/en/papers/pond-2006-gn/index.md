abstract: 'Several codon-based methods are available for detecting adaptive evolution
  in protein-coding sequences, but to date none specifically identify sites that are
  selected differentially in two populations, although such comparisons between populations
  have been historically useful in identifying the action of natural selection. We
  have developed two fixed effects maximum likelihood methods: one for identifying
  codon positions showing selection patterns that persist in a population and another
  for detecting whether selection is operating differentially on individual codons
  of a gene sampled from two different populations. Applying these methods to two
  HIV populations infecting genetically distinct human hosts, we have found that few
  of the positively selected amino acid sites persist in the population; the other
  changes are detected only at the tips of the phylogenetic tree and appear deleterious
  in the long term. Additionally, we have identified seven amino acid sites in protease
  and reverse transcriptase that are selected differentially in the two samples, demonstrating
  specific population-level adaptation of HIV to human populations.'
