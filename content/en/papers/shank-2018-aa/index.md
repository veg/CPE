abstract: 'BACKGROUND: While several JavaScript packages for visualizing phylogenetic
  trees exist, most are best characterized as frameworks that are designed with a
  specific set of tasks in mind. Extending such packages to use cases that are not
  available as features often ends up being difficult. Moreover, existing packages
  tend to produce standalone widgets that are not designed to serve as middleware,
  as opposed to flexible tools that can integrate with other components of an application.
  RESULTS: phylotree.js is a library that extends the popular data visualization framework
  d3.js, and is suitable for building JavaScript applications where users can view
  and interact with phylogenetic trees. The effects of such interactions can be captured
  and communicated to other package components, making it possible to engineer complex
  and responsive applications that include phylogenetic trees. phylotree.js implements
  several abstractions in addition to features, and comes with a documented application
  programming interface, thus promoting interoperability and extensibility. Example
  applications include a tool to visualize and annotate phylogenetic trees, a web
  application for comparative sequence analysis, a structural viewer that interacts
  with a large phylogenetic tree, and an interactive tanglegram. CONCLUSIONS: phylotree.js
  is a useful tool and application module for a variety of computational biology software
  applications. The code is available on Github and is released under the MIT license.'
