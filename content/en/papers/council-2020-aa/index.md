abstract: Concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STI) can increase the probability
  of HIV-1 transmission primarily by increasing the viral load present in semen. In
  this study, we explored the relationship of HIV-1 in blood and seminal plasma in
  the presence and absence of urethritis and after treatment of the concurrent STI.
  Primer ID deep sequencing of the V1/V3 region of the HIV-1 env gene was done for
  paired blood and semen samples from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive men living
  in Malawi with (n = 19) and without (n = 5) STI-associated urethritis; for a subset
  of samples, full-length env genes were generated for sequence analysis and to test
  entry phenotype. Cytokine concentrations in the blood and semen were also measured,
  and a reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines was observed following
  STI treatment. We observed no difference in the prevalence of diverse compartmentalized
  semen-derived lineages in men with or without STI-associated urethritis, and these
  viral populations were largely stable during STI treatment. Clonal amplification
  of one or a few viral sequences accounted for nearly 50% of the viral population,
  indicating a recent bottleneck followed by limited viral replication. We conclude
  that the male genital tract is a site where virus can be brought in from the blood,
  where localized sustained replication can occur, and where specific genotypes can
  be amplified, perhaps initially by cellular proliferation but further by limited
  viral replication.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infection is a sexually transmitted infection
  that coexists with other STI. Here, we examined the impact of a concurrent STI resulting
  in urethritis on the HIV-1 population within the male genital tract. We found that
  viral populations remain largely stable even with treatment of the STI. These results
  show that viral populations within the male genital tract are defined by factors
  beyond transient inflammation associated with a concurrent STI.
