abstract: Relaxation of selective strength, manifested as a reduction in the efficiency
  or intensity of natural selection, can drive evolutionary innovation and presage
  lineage extinction or loss of function. Mechanisms through which selection can be
  relaxed range from the removal of an existing selective constraint to a reduction
  in effective population size. Standard methods for estimating the strength and extent
  of purifying or positive selection from molecular sequence data are not suitable
  for detecting relaxed selection, because they lack power and can mistake an increase
  in the intensity of positive selection for relaxation of both purifying and positive
  selection. Here, we present a general hypothesis testing framework (RELAX) for detecting
  relaxed selection in a codon-based phylogenetic framework. Given two subsets of
  branches in a phylogeny, RELAX can determine whether selective strength was relaxed
  or intensified in one of these subsets relative to the other. We establish the validity
  of our test via simulations and show that it can distinguish between increased positive
  selection and a relaxation of selective strength. We also demonstrate the power
  of RELAX in a variety of biological scenarios where relaxation of selection has
  been hypothesized or demonstrated previously. We find that obligate and facultative
  Î³-proteobacteria endosymbionts of insects are under relaxed selection compared with
  their free-living relatives and obligate endosymbionts are under relaxed selection
  compared with facultative endosymbionts. Selective strength is also relaxed in asexual
  Daphnia pulex lineages, compared with sexual lineages. Endogenous, nonfunctional,
  bornavirus-like elements are found to be under relaxed selection compared with exogenous
  Borna viruses. Finally, selection on the short-wavelength sensitive, SWS1, opsin
  genes in echolocating and nonecholocating bats is relaxed only in lineages in which
  this gene underwent pseudogenization; however, selection on the functional medium/long-wavelength
  sensitive opsin, M/LWS1, is found to be relaxed in all echolocating bats compared
  with nonecholocating bats.
