abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Phylogenetic and evolutionary inference can be severely misled
  if recombination is not accounted for, hence screening for it should be an essential
  component of nearly every comparative study. The evolution of recombinant sequences
  can not be properly explained by a single phylogenetic tree, but several phylogenies
  may be used to correctly model the evolution of non-recombinant fragments. RESULTS:
  We developed a likelihood-based model selection procedure that uses a genetic algorithm
  to search multiple sequence alignments for evidence of recombination breakpoints
  and identify putative recombinant sequences. GARD is an extensible and intuitive
  method that can be run efficiently in parallel. Extensive simulation studies show
  that the method nearly always outperforms other available tools, both in terms of
  power and accuracy and that the use of GARD to screen sequences for recombination
  ensures good statistical properties for methods aimed at detecting positive selection.
