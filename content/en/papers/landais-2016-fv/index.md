abstract: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are thought to be a critical component
  of a protective HIV vaccine. However, designing vaccines immunogens able to elicit
  bnAbs has proven unsuccessful to date. Understanding the correlates and immunological
  mechanisms leading to the development of bnAb responses during natural HIV infection
  is thus critical to the design of a protective vaccine. The IAVI Protocol C program
  investigates a large longitudinal cohort of primary HIV-1 infection in Eastern and
  South Africa. Development of neutralization was evaluated in 439 donors using a
  6 cross-clade pseudo-virus panel predictive of neutralization breadth on larger
  panels. About 15% of individuals developed bnAb responses, essentially between year
  2 and year 4 of infection. Statistical analyses revealed no influence of gender,
  age or geographical origin on the development of neutralization breadth. However,
  cross-clade neutralization strongly correlated with high viral load as well as with
  low CD4 T cell counts, subtype-C infection and HLA-A*03(-) genotype. A correlation
  with high overall plasma IgG levels and anti-Env IgG binding titers was also found.
  The latter appeared not associated with higher affinity, suggesting a greater diversity
  of the anti-Env responses in broad neutralizers. Broadly neutralizing activity targeting
  glycan-dependent epitopes, largely the N332-glycan epitope region, was detected
  in nearly half of the broad neutralizers while CD4bs and gp41-MPER bnAb responses
  were only detected in very few individuals. Together the findings suggest that both
  viral and host factors are critical for the development of bnAbs and that the HIV
  Env N332-glycan supersite may be a favorable target for vaccine design.
