abstract: Several groups have proposed that genotypic determinants in gag and the
  gp41 cytoplasmic domain (gp41-CD) reduce protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility
  without PI-resistance mutations in protease. However, no gag and gp41-CD mutations
  definitively responsible for reduced PI susceptibility have been identified in individuals
  with virological failure (VF) while receiving a boosted PI (PI/r)-containing regimen.
  To identify gag and gp41 mutations under selective PI pressure, we sequenced gag
  and/or gp41 in 61 individuals with VF on a PI/r (n = 40) or NNRTI (n = 20) containing
  regimen. We quantified nonsynonymous and synonymous changes in both genes and identified
  sites exhibiting signal for directional or diversifying selection. We also used
  published gag and gp41 polymorphism data to highlight mutations displaying a high
  selection index, defined as changing from a conserved to an uncommon amino acid.
  Many amino acid mutations developed in gag and in gp41-CD in both the PI- and NNRTI-treated
  groups. However, in neither gene, were there discernable differences between the
  two groups in overall numbers of mutations, mutations displaying evidence of diversifying
  or directional selection, or mutations with a high selection index. If gag and/or
  gp41 encode PI-resistance mutations, they may not be confined to consistent mutations
  at a few sites.
