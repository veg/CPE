abstract: The emergence and rapid rise in prevalence of three independent SARS-CoV-2
  \"501Y lineages'', B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, in the last three months of 2020 has
  prompted renewed concerns about the evolutionarily capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to adapt
  to both rising population immunity, and public health interventions such as vaccines
  and social distancing. Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have,
  presumably under intense natural selection following a shift in host environment,
  independently acquired multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence
  all have gained epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate
  the control of COVID-19. Here, by examining patterns of mutations that arose in
  SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the
  selective forces acting on immunologically important SARS-CoV-2 genes (such as N
  and S) that likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition
  to involving continuing sequence diversification, we find evidence that a significant
  portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further
  convergence between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring
  how members of these known 501Y lineages, and others still undiscovered, are convergently
  evolving similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting
  infection and vaccine induced host immune recognition.
