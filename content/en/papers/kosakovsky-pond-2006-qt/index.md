abstract: The evolution of homologous sequences affected by recombination or gene
  conversion cannot be adequately explained by a single phylogenetic tree. Many tree-based
  methods for sequence analysis, for example, those used for detecting sites evolving
  nonneutrally, have been shown to fail if such phylogenetic incongruity is ignored.
  However, it may be possible to propose several phylogenies that can correctly model
  the evolution of nonrecombinant fragments. We propose a model-based framework that
  uses a genetic algorithm to search a multiple-sequence alignment for putative recombination
  break points, quantifies the level of support for their locations, and identifies
  sequences or clades involved in putative recombination events. The software implementation
  can be run quickly and efficiently in a distributed computing environment, and various
  components of the methods can be chosen for computational expediency or statistical
  rigor. We evaluate the performance of the new method on simulated alignments and
  on an array of published benchmark data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that prescreening
  alignments with our method allows one to analyze recombinant sequences for positive
  selection.
