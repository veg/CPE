abstract: "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) commonly cause mild enteric infections in\
  \ felines worldwide (termed feline enteric coronavirus [FECV]), with around 12 per\
  \ centâ€‰developing into deadly feline infectious peritonitis (FIP; feline infectious\
  \ peritonitis virus [FIPV]). Genomic differences between FECV and FIPV have been\
  \ reported, yet the putative genotypic basis of the highly pathogenic phenotype\
  \ remains unclear. Here, we used state-of-the-art molecular evolutionary genetic\
  \ statistical techniques to identify and compare differences in natural selection\
  \ pressure between FECV and FIPV sequences, as well as to identify FIPV- and FECV-specific\
  \ signals of positive selection. We analyzed full-length FCoV protein coding genes\
  \ thought to contain mutations associated with FIPV (Spike, ORF3abc, and ORF7ab).\
  \ We identified two sites exhibiting differences in natural selection pressure between\
  \ FECV and FIPV: one within the S1/S2 furin cleavage site (FCS) and the other within\
  \ the fusion domain of Spike. We also found fifteen sites subject to positive selection\
  \ associated with FIPV within Spike, eleven of which have not previously been suggested\
  \ as possibly relevant to FIP development. These sites fall within Spike protein\
  \ subdomains that participate in host cell receptor interaction, immune evasion,\
  \ tropism shifts, host cellular entry, and viral escape. There were fourteen sites\
  \ (twelve novel sites) within Spike under positive selection associated with the\
  \ FECV phenotype, almost exclusively within the S1/S2 FCS and adjacent to C domain,\
  \ along with a signal of relaxed selection in FIPV relative to FECV, suggesting\
  \ that furin cleavage functionality may not be needed for FIPV. Positive selection\
  \ inferred in ORF7b was associated with the FECV phenotype and included twenty-four\
  \ positively selected sites, while ORF7b had signals of relaxed selection in FIPV.\
  \ We found evidence of positive selection in ORF3c in FCoV-wide analyses, but no\
  \ specific association with the FIPV or FECV phenotype. We hypothesize that some\
  \ combination of mutations in FECV may contribute to FIP development, and that it\
  \ is unlikely to be one singular 'switch' mutational event. This work expands our\
  \ understanding of the complexities of FIP development and provides insights into\
  \ how evolutionary forces may alter pathogenesis in coronavirus genomes."
