 abstract = {Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) commonly cause mild enteric infections in felines worldwide (termed feline enteric coronavirus [FECV]), with around 12 per centâ€‰developing into deadly feline infectious peritonitis (FIP; feline infectious peritonitis virus [FIPV]). Genomic differences between FECV and FIPV have been reported, yet the putative genotypic basis of the highly pathogenic phenotype remains unclear. Here, we used state-of-the-art molecular evolutionary genetic statistical techniques to identify and compare differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV sequences, as well as to identify FIPV- and FECV-specific signals of positive selection. We analyzed full-length FCoV protein coding genes thought to contain mutations associated with FIPV (Spike, ORF3abc, and ORF7ab). We identified two sites exhibiting differences in natural selection pressure between FECV and FIPV: one within the S1/S2 furin cleavage site (FCS) and the other within the fusion domain of Spike. We also found fifteen sites subject to positive selection associated with FIPV within Spike, eleven of which have not previously been suggested as possibly relevant to FIP development. These sites fall within Spike protein subdomains that participate in host cell receptor interaction, immune evasion, tropism shifts, host cellular entry, and viral escape. There were fourteen sites (twelve novel sites) within Spike under positive selection associated with the FECV phenotype, almost exclusively within the S1/S2 FCS and adjacent to C domain, along with a signal of relaxed selection in FIPV relative to FECV, suggesting that furin cleavage functionality may not be needed for FIPV. Positive selection inferred in ORF7b was associated with the FECV phenotype and included twenty-four positively selected sites, while ORF7b had signals of relaxed selection in FIPV. We found evidence of positive selection in ORF3c in FCoV-wide analyses, but no specific association with the FIPV or FECV phenotype. We hypothesize that some combination of mutations in FECV may contribute to FIP development, and that it is unlikely to be one singular 'switch' mutational event. This work expands our understanding of the complexities of FIP development and provides insights into how evolutionary forces may alter pathogenesis in coronavirus genomes.},
