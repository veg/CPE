abstract: Most HIV-1-infected individuals with virological failure on a pharmacologically-boosted
  protease inhibitor (PI) regimen do not develop PI-resistance protease mutations.
  One proposed explanation is that HIV-1 gag or gp41 cytoplasmic domain mutations
  might also reduce PI susceptibility. In a recent study of paired gag and gp41 sequences
  from individuals with virological failure on a PI regimen, we did not identify PI-selected
  mutations and concluded that if such mutations existed, larger numbers of paired
  sequences from multiple studies would be needed for their identification. In this
  study, we generated site-specific amino acid profiles using gag and gp41 published
  sequences from 5,338 and 4,242 ART-naı̈ve individuals, respectively, to assist researchers
  identify unusual mutations arising during therapy and to provide scripts for performing
  established and novel maximal likelihood estimates of dN/dS substitution rates in
  paired sequences. The pipelines used to generate the curated sequences, amino acid
  profiles, and dN/dS analyses will facilitate the application of consistent methods
  to paired gag and gp41 sequence datasets and expedite the identification of potential
  sites under PI-selection pressure.
