abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) dual infection
  (DI) has been associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads;
  however, the frequency of intrasubtype DI is poorly understood. We used ultradeep
  sequencing (UDS) to estimate the frequency of DI in a primary infection cohort of
  predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS:  HIV-1 genomes from longitudinal
  blood samples of recently infected, therapy-naive participants were interrogated
  with UDS. DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported
  by phylogenetic analysis. Coinfection was defined as DI at baseline; superinfection
  was monoinfection at baseline and DI at a later time point. RESULTS:  Of 118 participants,
  7 were coinfected and 10 acquired superinfection. Superinfection incidence rate
  was 4.96 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-9.22); 6 occurred
  in the first year and 4 in the second. Overall cumulative prevalence of intrasubtype
  B DI was 14.4% (95% CI, 8.6%-22.1%). Primary HIV-1 incidence was 4.37 per 100 person-years
  (95% CI, 3.56-5.36). CONCLUSIONS:  Intrasubtype DI was frequent and comparable to
  primary infection rates among MSM in San Diego; however, superinfection rates declined
  over time. DI is likely an important component of the HIV epidemic dynamics, and
  development of stronger immune responses to the initial infection may protect from
  superinfection.'
