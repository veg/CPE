abstract: Viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) are proteins that actively inhibit the
  antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) immune response, providing an immune evasion route
  for viruses. It has been hypothesized that VSRs are engaged in a molecular 'arms
  race' with RNAi pathway genes. Two lines of evidence support this. First, VSRs from
  plant viruses display high sequence diversity, and are frequently gained and lost
  over evolutionary time scales. Second, Drosophila antiviral RNAi genes show high
  rates of adaptive evolution. Here, we investigate whether VSRs diversify faster
  than other genes and, if so, whether this is a result of positive selection, as
  might be expected in an arms race. By analysis of 12 plant RNA viruses, we show
  that the relative rate of protein evolution is higher for VSRs than for other genes,
  but that this is not attributable to pervasive positive selection. We argue that,
  because evolutionary time scales are extremely different for viruses and eukaryotes,
  it is improbable that viral adaptation (as measured by the ratio of non-synonymous
  to synonymous change) will be dominated by one-to-one coevolution with eukaryotes.
  Instead, for plant virus VSRs, we find strong evidence of episodic selection--diversifying
  selection that acts on a subset of lineages--which might be attributable to frequent
  shifts between different host genotypes or species.
