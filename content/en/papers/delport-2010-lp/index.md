abstract: The single rate codon model of non-synonymous substitution is ubiquitous
  in phylogenetic modeling. Indeed, the use of a non-synonymous to synonymous substitution
  rate ratio parameter has facilitated the interpretation of selection pressure on
  genomes. Although the single rate model has achieved wide acceptance, we argue that
  the assumption of a single rate of non-synonymous substitution is biologically unreasonable,
  given observed differences in substitution rates evident from empirical amino acid
  models. Some have attempted to incorporate amino acid substitution biases into models
  of codon evolution and have shown improved model performance versus the single rate
  model. Here, we show that the single rate model of non-synonymous substitution is
  easily outperformed by a model with multiple non-synonymous rate classes, yet in
  which amino acid substitution pairs are assigned randomly to these classes. We argue
  that, since the single rate model is so easy to improve upon, new codon models should
  not be validated entirely on the basis of improved model fit over this model. Rather,
  we should strive to both improve on the single rate model and to approximate the
  general time-reversible model of codon substitution, with as few parameters as possible,
  so as to reduce model over-fitting. We hint at how this can be achieved with a Genetic
  Algorithm approach in which rate classes are assigned on the basis of sequence information
  content.
