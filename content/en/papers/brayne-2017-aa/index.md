abstract: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis
  globally. HEV comprises four genotypes with different geographic distributions and
  host ranges. We utilize this natural case-control study for investigating the evolution
  of zoonotic viruses compared to single-host viruses, using 244 near-full-length
  HEV genomes. Genome-wide estimates of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary
  changes (dN/dS ratio) located a region of overlapping reading frames, which is subject
  to positive selection in genotypes 3 and 4. The open reading frames (ORFs) involved
  have functions related to host-pathogen interaction, so genotype-specific evolution
  of these regions may reflect their fitness. Bayesian inference of evolutionary rates
  shows that genotypes 3 and 4 have significantly higher rates than genotype 1 across
  all ORFs. Reconstruction of the phylogenies of zoonotic genotypes demonstrates significant
  intermingling of isolates between hosts. We speculate that the genotype-specific
  differences may result from cyclical adaptation to different hosts in genotypes
  3 and 4.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is increasingly recognized as a pathogen
  that affects both the developing and the developed world. While most often clinically
  mild, HEV can be severe or fatal in certain demographics, such as expectant mothers.
  Like many other viral pathogens, HEV has been classified into several distinct genotypes.
  We show that most of the HEV genome is evolutionarily constrained. One locus of
  positive selection is unusual in that it encodes two distinct protein products.
  We are the first to detect positive selection in this overlap region. Genotype 1,
  which infects humans only, appears to be evolving differently from genotypes 3 and
  4, which infect multiple species, possibly because genotypes 3 and 4 are unable
  to achieve the same fitness due to repeated host jumps.
