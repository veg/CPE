abstract: 'Although most laboratories are capable of employing established protocols
  to perform full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, many are unable to assess sequence
  quality, select appropriate mutation-detection thresholds, or report on the potential
  clinical significance of mutations in the targets of antiviral therapy METHODS:
  We describe the technical aspects and benchmark the performance of Sierra SARS-CoV-2,
  a program designed to perform these functions on user-submitted FASTQ and FASTA
  sequence files and lists of Spike mutations. Sierra SARS-CoV-2 indicates which sequences
  contain an unexpectedly large number of unusual mutations and which mutations are
  associated with reduced susceptibility to clinical stage mAbs, the RdRP inhibitor
  remdesivir, or the Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir RESULTS: To assess the performance
  of Sierra SARS-CoV-2 on FASTQ files, we applied it to 600 representative FASTQ sequences
  and compared the results to the COVID-19 EDGE program. To assess its performance
  on FASTA files, we applied it to nearly one million representative FASTA sequences
  and compared the results to the GISAID mutation annotation. To assess its performance
  on mutations lists, we applied it to 13,578 distinct Spike RBD mutation patterns
  and showed that exactly or partially matching annotations were available for 88%
  of patterns CONCLUSION: Sierra SARS-CoV-2 leverages previously published data to
  improve the quality control of submitted viral genomic data and to provide functional
  annotation on the impact of mutations in the targets of antiviral SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
