abstract: Two years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, key questions about
  the emergence of its aetiological agent (SARS-CoV-2) remain a matter of considerable
  debate. Identifying when SARS-CoV-2 began spreading among people is one of those
  questions. Although the current canonically accepted timeline hypothesises viral
  emergence in Wuhan, China, in November or December 2019, a growing body of diverse
  studies provides evidence that the virus may have been spreading worldwide weeks,
  or even months, prior to that time. However, the hypothesis of earlier SARS-CoV-2
  circulation is often dismissed with prejudicial scepticism and experimental studies
  pointing to early origins are frequently and speculatively attributed to false-positive
  tests. In this paper, we critically review current evidence that SARS-CoV-2 had
  been circulating prior to December of 2019, and emphasise how, despite some scientific
  limitations, this hypothesis should no longer be ignored and considered sufficient
  to warrant further larger-scale studies to determine its veracity.
