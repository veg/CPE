abstract: "The lack of an identifiable intermediate host species for the proximal\
  \ animal ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, and the large geographical distance between Wuhan\
  \ and where the closest evolutionary related coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe\
  \ bats (members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus) have been identified, is fueling speculation\
  \ on the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. We performed a comprehensive phylogenetic\
  \ study on SARS-CoV-2 and all the related bat and pangolin sarbecoviruses sampled\
  \ so far. Determining the likely recombination events reveals a highly reticulate\
  \ evolutionary history within this group of coronaviruses. Distribution of the inferred\
  \ recombination events is nonrandom with evidence that Spike, the main target for\
  \ humoral immunity, is beside a recombination hotspot likely driving antigenic shift\
  \ events in the ancestry of bat sarbecoviruses. Coupled with the geographic ranges\
  \ of their hosts and the sampling locations, across southern China, and into Southeast\
  \ Asia, we confirm that horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus, are the likely reservoir species\
  \ for the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor. By tracing the recombinant sequence patterns, we\
  \ conclude that there has been relatively recent geographic movement and cocirculation\
  \ of these viruses' ancestors, extending across their bat host ranges in China and\
  \ Southeast Asia over the last 100 years. We confirm that a direct proximal ancestor\
  \ to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been sampled, since the closest known relatives collected\
  \ in Yunnan shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 approximately 40 years ago.\
  \ Our analysis highlights the need for dramatically more wildlife sampling to: 1)\
  \ pinpoint the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2's animal progenitor, 2) the intermediate\
  \ species that facilitated transmission from bats to humans (if there is one), and\
  \ 3) survey the extent of the diversity in the related sarbecoviruses' phylogeny\
  \ that present high risk for future spillovers."
