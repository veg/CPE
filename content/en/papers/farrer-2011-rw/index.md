abstract: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a globally ubiquitous fungal infection
  that has emerged to become a primary driver of amphibian biodiversity loss. Despite
  widespread effort to understand the emergence of this panzootic, the origins of
  the infection, its patterns of global spread, and principle mode of evolution remain
  largely unknown. Using comparative population genomics, we discovered three deeply
  diverged lineages of Bd associated with amphibians. Two of these lineages were found
  in multiple continents and are associated with known introductions by the amphibian
  trade. We found that isolates belonging to one clade, the global panzootic lineage
  (BdGPL) have emerged across at least five continents during the 20th century and
  are associated with the onset of epizootics in North America, Central America, the
  Caribbean, Australia, and Europe. The two newly identified divergent lineages, Cape
  lineage (BdCAPE) and Swiss lineage (BdCH), were found to differ in morphological
  traits when compared against one another and BdGPL, and we show that BdGPL is hypervirulent.
  BdGPL uniquely bears the hallmarks of genomic recombination, manifested as extensive
  intergenomic phylogenetic conflict and patchily distributed heterozygosity. We postulate
  that contact between previously genetically isolated allopatric populations of Bd
  may have allowed recombination to occur, resulting in the generation, spread, and
  invasion of the hypervirulent BdGPL leading to contemporary disease-driven losses
  in amphibian biodiversity.
