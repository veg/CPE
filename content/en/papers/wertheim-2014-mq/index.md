abstract: 'Herpesviruses have been infecting and codiverging with their vertebrate
  hosts for hundreds of millions of years. The primate simplex viruses exemplify this
  pattern of virus-host codivergence, at a minimum, as far back as the most recent
  common ancestor of New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and apes. Humans are the
  only primate species known to be infected with two distinct herpes simplex viruses:
  HSV-1 and HSV-2. Human herpes simplex viruses are ubiquitous, with over two-thirds
  of the human population infected by at least one virus. Here, we investigated whether
  the additional human simplex virus is the result of ancient viral lineage duplication
  or cross-species transmission. We found that standard phylogenetic models of nucleotide
  substitution are inadequate for distinguishing among these competing hypotheses;
  the extent of synonymous substitutions causes a substantial underestimation of the
  lengths of some of the branches in the phylogeny, consistent with observations in
  other viruses (e.g., avian influenza, Ebola, and coronaviruses). To more accurately
  estimate ancient viral divergence times, we applied a branch-site random effects
  likelihood model of molecular evolution that allows the strength of natural selection
  to vary across both the viral phylogeny and the gene alignment. This selection-informed
  model favored a scenario in which HSV-1 is the result of ancient codivergence and
  HSV-2 arose from a cross-species transmission event from the ancestor of modern
  chimpanzees to an extinct Homo precursor of modern humans, around 1.6 Ma. These
  results provide a new framework for understanding human herpes simplex virus evolution
  and demonstrate the importance of using selection-informed models of sequence evolution
  when investigating viral origin hypotheses.'
