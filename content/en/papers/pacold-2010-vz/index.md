abstract: Current methods to detect intraclade HIV dual infection are poorly suited
  for determining its prevalence in large cohorts. To investigate the potential of
  ultra-deep sequencing to screen for dual infection, we compared it to bulk sequence-based
  synonymous mixture index and the current standard of single genome sequencing. The
  synonymous mixture index identified samples likely to harbor dual infection, while
  ultra-deep sequencing captured more intra-host viral diversity than single genome
  sequencing at approximately 40% of the cost and 20% of the laboratory and analysis
  time. The synonymous mixture index and ultra-deep sequencing are promising methods
  for rapid and cost-effective systematic identification of HIV dual infection.
