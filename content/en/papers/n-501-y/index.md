abstract: The independent emergence late in 2020 of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1
  lineages of SARS-CoV-2 prompted renewed concerns about the evolutionary capacity
  of this virus to overcome public health interventions and rising population immunity.
  Here, by examining patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations that have
  accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 genomes since the pandemic began, we find that the emergence
  of these three \"501Y lineages\" coincided with a major global shift in the selective
  forces acting on various SARS-CoV-2 genes. Following their emergence, the adaptive
  evolution of 501Y lineage viruses has involved repeated selectively favored convergent
  mutations at 35 genome sites, mutations we refer to as the 501Y meta-signature.
  The ongoing convergence of viruses in many other lineages on this meta-signature
  suggests that it includes multiple mutation combinations capable of promoting the
  persistence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the face of mounting host immune recognition.
