abstract: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) PG9 and PG16 were isolated from
  an International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Protocol G subject infected with
  human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clade A. Both antibodies are highly
  potent and neutralize greater than 70% of viruses tested. We sought to begin immunogen
  design based on viral sequences from this patient; however, pseudoviruses prepared
  with 19 envelope sequences from this subject were resistant to neutralization by
  PG9 and PG16. Therefore, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify closely related
  viruses that were potentially sensitive to PG9 and PG16. A most-recent common ancestor
  (MRCA) sequence for the viral envelope (Env) was determined and aligned with 99
  subtype A gp160 sequences from the Los Alamos HIV database. Virus BG505.W6M.ENV.C2
  (BG505) was found to have the highest degree of homology (73%) to the MRCA sequence.
  Pseudoviruses prepared with this Env were sensitive to neutralization with a broad
  panel of bNAbs, including PG9 and PG16. When expressed by 293T cells as soluble
  gp120, the BG505 monomer bound well to both PG9 and PG16. We further showed that
  a point mutation (L111A) enabled more efficient production of a stable gp120 monomer
  that preserves the major neutralization epitopes. Finally, we showed that an adjuvanted
  formulation of this gp120 protein elicited neutralizing antibodies in rabbits (following
  a gp120 DNA vaccine prime) and that the antisera competed with bNAbs from 3 classes
  of nonoverlapping epitopes. Thus, the BG505 Env protein warrants further investigation
  as an HIV vaccine candidate, as a stand-alone protein, or as a component of a vaccine
  vector.
