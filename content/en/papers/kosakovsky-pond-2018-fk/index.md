abstract: "In modern applications of molecular epidemiology, genetic sequence data\
  \ are routinely used to identify clusters of transmission in rapidly evolving pathogens,\
  \ most notably HIV-1. Traditional 'shoe-leather' epidemiology infers transmission\
  \ clusters by tracing chains of partners sharing epidemiological connections (e.g.,\
  \ sexual contact). Here, we present a computational tool for identifying a molecular\
  \ transmission analog of such clusters: HIV-TRACE (TRAnsmission Cluster Engine).\
  \ HIV-TRACE implements an approach inspired by traditional epidemiology, by identifying\
  \ chains of partners whose viral genetic relatedness imply direct or indirect epidemiological\
  \ connections. Molecular transmission clusters are constructed using codon-aware\
  \ pairwise alignment to a reference sequence followed by pairwise genetic distance\
  \ estimation among all sequences. This approach is computationally tractable and\
  \ is capable of identifying HIV-1 transmission clusters in large surveillance databases\
  \ comprising tens or hundreds of thousands of sequences in near real time, that\
  \ is, on the order of minutes to hours. HIV-TRACE is available at www.hivtrace.org\
  \ and from www.github.com/veg/hivtrace, along with the accompanying result visualization\
  \ module from www.github.com/veg/hivtrace-viz. Importantly, the approach underlying\
  \ HIV-TRACE is not limited to the study of HIV-1 and can be applied to study outbreaks\
  \ and epidemics of other rapidly evolving pathogens."
