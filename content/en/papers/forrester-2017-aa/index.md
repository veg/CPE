abstract: Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex alphaviruses are important
  re-emerging arboviruses that cause life-threatening disease in equids during epizootics
  as well as spillover human infections. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of
  VEE complex alphaviruses by sequencing the genomes of 94 strains and performing
  phylogenetic analyses of 130 isolates using complete open reading frames for the
  nonstructural and structural polyproteins. Our analyses confirmed purifying selection
  as a major mechanism influencing the evolution of these viruses as well as a confounding
  factor in molecular clock dating of ancestors. Times to most recent common ancestors
  (tMRCAs) could be robustly estimated only for the more recently diverged subtypes;
  the tMRCA of the ID/IAB/IC/II and IE clades of VEE virus (VEEV) were estimated at
  ca. 149-973 years ago. Evolution of the IE subtype has been characterized by a significant
  evolutionary shift from the rest of the VEEV complex, with an increase in structural
  protein substitutions that are unique to this group, possibly reflecting adaptation
  to its unique enzootic mosquito vector Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus. Our inferred
  tree topologies suggest that VEEV is maintained primarily in situ, with only occasional
  spread to neighboring countries, probably reflecting the limited mobility of rodent
  hosts and mosquito vectors.
