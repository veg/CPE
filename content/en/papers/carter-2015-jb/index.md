abstract: To better understand the dynamics of HIV-specific neutralizing antibody
  (NAb), we examined associations between viral genetic diversity and the NAb response
  against a multi-subtype panel of heterologous viruses in a well-characterized, therapy-naı̈ve
  primary infection cohort. Using next generation sequencing (NGS), we computed sequence-based
  measures of diversity within HIV-1 env, gag and pol, and compared them to NAb breadth
  and potency as calculated by a neutralization score. Contemporaneous env diversity
  and the neutralization score were positively correlated (p=0.0033), as were the
  neutralization score and estimated duration of infection (EDI) (p=0.0038), and env
  diversity and EDI (p=0.0005). Neither early env diversity nor baseline viral load
  correlated with future NAb breadth and potency (p>0.05). Taken together, it is unlikely
  that neutralizing capability in our cohort was conditioned on viral diversity, but
  rather that env evolution was driven by the level of NAb selective pressure.
